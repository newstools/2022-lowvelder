Despite the fact that the backlog for renewing driver’s licences is approximately at 100 000, additional traffic officers will be deployed in Mpumalanga to be on the lookout for motorists still using expired ones.
Moeti Mmusi, the provincial spokesperson for the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, said motorists who failed to renew their driver’s licence cards during the grace period will be fined, unless they are in possession of the necessary documentation proving that they are awaiting new licences.

They can expect fines when they are caught. We put all the plans in place to make sure that our system functions well. We extended working hours at our offices and we even worked on weekends to make sure that we accommodated everyone,” he said.

We want motorists to avoid fines and their insurance not paying claims when they are involved in accidents,” he said.
Mmusi also thanked the motorists who had renewed their licences and appealed to those who are still waiting for their new ones to be patient while the cards were being processed.
“Our national office is working around the clock to make sure that the backlog comes to an end. Once their cards have been issued, we will send an SMS so that they can come and collect them,” he concluded.
