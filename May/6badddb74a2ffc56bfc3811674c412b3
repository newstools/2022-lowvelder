Pediatric Care Africa (PCA) is teaming up with Sizabantu Piping Systems in a bid to collect 1 000 blankets for the coming winter months. In a statement by PCA, it said many people will face a very cold winter without blankets to keep them warm, and so the idea of the “20 days of giving” blanket drive was born. “We thought it was a great idea as we have a blanket drive every year. Many people are in an exceptionally desperate need this winter due to the recent disasters in South Africa,” said PCA in the statement. ALSO READ: Monthly donation will help chamber to continue cleaning project “There are many families in Mpumalanga that are facing a harsh winter due to a complete lack of warm blankets and warm clothing. The pandemic has made hundreds of people homeless in our province.” The statement went on to say that the need is especially high as the drive aims to deliver a few hundred blankets and baby food to some of the thousands of people in KwaZulu-Natal, who have lost everything due to the floods. ALSO READ: Tender fraud trial date set “We are pleading with people to open their hearts and help someone in distress. This is a time for us to stand together as one people,” said PCA’s statement.  Any donations can be delivered to Sizabantu at 20 Van Bergen Street, Mbombela or Lowveld Vet at 27 Palm Street in White River. People can also leave their donations at the White River Garden Pavilion Nursery in Witklip Street. Enquiries: Sizabantu Piping Systems on 013 755 2707. Do you have more information about the story?
