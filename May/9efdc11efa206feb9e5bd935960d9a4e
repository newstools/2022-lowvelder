The founder of We Care 4 Nelspruit, TJ Maré, said that despite undergoing surgical procedures to both his hands, he is determined to keep the city clean.  Maré had to undergo the operation to address carpal tunnel syndrome, which affects the use of his hands and is very painful. He told Lowvelder that he was recovering well and his team was continuing to clean the City of Mbombela’s (CoM) parks and streets, despite many challenges. “We have a team that we need to pay and we also need fuel and plastics bags. We do have sponsors coming on board, however, most of our activities need cash flow. We plead with community members to donate cash or adopt a worker, or identify a spot that they can clean for us,” he said. Maré said We Care 4 Nelspruit does not receive any assistance from the municipality or provincial government, even though they acknowledge the work We Care 4 Nelspruit is doing in the city.

We hope that the City of Mbombela will also join in and support the organisation, because we are undertaking tasks that are its responsibility. Those who are interested in supporting us can pledge funds or equipment via Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism,” he said. Maré added that they are currently working on the Old Pretoria Road after which all the entrances to Mbombela will be tackled. The spokesperson for CoM, Joseph Ngala, was unavailable for comment at the time of going to press. Do you have more information about the story? Please send us an email to editorial@lowvelder.co.za.
