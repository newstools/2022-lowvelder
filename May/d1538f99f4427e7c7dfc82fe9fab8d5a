It was a fun-filled day of face painting and Easter egg hunting for families across the Lowveld at the Easter Eggstravaganza on Wednesday April 27. Held at the Lowveld Botanical Garden and hosted by the Riverside CID, the event kicked of at 11:00 with a stunning walk from the Southern Sun Emnotweni Hotel to the botanical garden. Along the route were various wine stalls hosted by Varietals for the adults to enjoy. After reaching the garden, the visitors were directed towards the Eggstravaganza by following signs and cute decorative Easter-themed cut-outs.

The Eggstravaganza created an area dedicated to the kiddies who took part face-painting, painting Easter eggs, a variety of sensory games, jumping castles and of course, the legendary Easter bunny who dished out Easter eggs. An Easter egg hunt was held for the children and even Zippy the Clown and his partner, Dotty, performed little magic tricks for the delighted children.
