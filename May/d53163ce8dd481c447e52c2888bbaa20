Three suspects appeared in the KaBokweni Magistrate’s Court today, Monday May 23, in connection with the murder of six-year-old Bontle Mashiyane. They are facing charges of kidnapping, human trafficking, rape and murder. They were remanded in custody until June 24 and have applied for Legal Aid assistance. Because the accused, who have previously been identified in the media, are facing a sex offence charge, their names have been withheld as prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Act. In terms of the act, they may only be identified in connection with the rape charge once they have pleaded.

“The investigation team was led to a scene where her body was discovered in thick bush, not far from her homestead, about 2km from her residence. Her body was found in a state of decomposition and mutilated,” said Mohlala.
