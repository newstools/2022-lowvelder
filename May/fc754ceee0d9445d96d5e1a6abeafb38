The Lowveld Botanical Society (BotSoc) enjoyed a shaded walk through the Tree Route at the Lowveld Botanical Garden on Saturday morning, April 23. The group met at the entrance to the garden at 09:30.  Wendy Williams, a member, said this route was established in 2013 as part of the Lowveld BotSoc’s contribution to the Botanical Society SA Centenary’s celebrations.
