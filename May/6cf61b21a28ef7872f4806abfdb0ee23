The ditches on Koraalboom Avenue still remain open, despite promises from the project manager, Independent Development Trust (IDT), responsible for building the alternative entrance to the Mbombela High Court, that it was supposed to start with the work by April 8.
Ward 16 counsellor Kyle Oliver said the City of Mbombela (CoM) wanted to close the ditches temporarily while the IDT sorts out its issues with the subcontractor. However, Sabelo Matu, the IDT’s project manager rejected the offer.

This department has been inundated with complaints and insurance claims for damage to vehicles from the public due to the state of the road crossings in Koraalboom Avenue.

As stated, this is a temporary fix and liability will remain with the appointed contractor.”
In response, Matu said, “The contractor will start working on April 8 and finish by April 17 on Karaalboom Avenue. I really do not know, having someone else working on the same road, what results it will yield.”
Oliver said it has been a month now since work was supposed to have started and the ditches are getting worse, forcing motorists to use alternative routes.
An effort to obtain comment from the IDT has been fruitless.
