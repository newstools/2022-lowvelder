 Pumbaa, a deserted warthog rescued in 2017, is the celebrity of Pumbaa Wildlife Park – a symbol of what is possible with human intervention. The owners of the park, Hennie and Melanie Maritz, agree that the best place for animals is in the wild. But what does one do with the wild and neglected animals born in captivity? “We do not breed. We are not a rehabilitation centre – we do not allow human contact. This is a place that will provide for any animal in need. A place strictly designed, managed and audited by the guidelines set by Nature Conservation and all the relevant government organisations. The park provides opportunities for creating awareness about the importance of nature and wild animals among the youth, schoolchildren and the public. This exposure is, for many youngsters, the first, the closest and the best nature experience they will ever have. They cannot touch, but they can see, up close, and smell and hear the animals. We do not allow unguided access, and all our guides are FGASA-qualified and dedicated to the welfare of the animals,” said Melanie. Stories about how the team – with the help of a veterinarian – spend many nights and hours to attend to sick animals in need, brought in from other facilities or captured situations, illustrate the authenticity beyond just the economics of a park like this. Their commitment is real emotional involvement.  “This park is both a recreational and educational facility. It contributes to the promotion of the Lowveld while also creating awareness about our human responsibility towards nature and animals. We have added accommodation facilities with a restaurant that is well supported by local and international visitors.  “Steve Irwin said, ‘The message is simple – we must love and conserve our wildlife.’
“We agree with Theodore Roosevelt, who said, ‘Wildlife and its habitat cannot speak, so we must and we will.’”
