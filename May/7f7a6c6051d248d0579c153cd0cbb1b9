It was a night of classic rock mixed with several well-loved Afrikaans songs at Skankane Transport on Saturday May 21.  Situated on the quiet Kaapsehoop Road, Skankane Transport opened its gates to Touch of Class fans just before 19:00. Music lovers came ready for a night of fun, bringing along their camping chairs, picnic baskets and some drinks.  With the colder weather now setting in, Skankane Transport made sure the guests were kept warm with small contained fires throughout the seating area.
