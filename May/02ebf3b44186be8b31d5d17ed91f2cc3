The South African singer, entertainer, radio announcer and comedian, Pieter Rischmüller, better known as Piet Pompies, paid visits to various local establishments last week. This entertainer set the stage alight, enthralling audiences with his foot stomping and pulsating body-swaying songs, as well as crowd favourites like “Living Next Door to Alice” and ACDC’s “Thunderstruck”.

Those who got it right were rewarded with a shot, which Piet Pompies had lined up at the front of the stage.  The band took a short break after performing for about an hour and mingled with the crowd before going on stage. Several people took to the floor and danced the evening away. Do you have more information about the story? Please send us an email to editorial@lowvelder.co.za.
