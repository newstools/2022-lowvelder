With just over 1 200 people flocking to Arch & Arrow for the Picnic Sundays’ Mother’s Day Concert, not even a sudden rainstorm could dampen the spirits of those in attendance. The music and entertainment for the day started out with Lucinda Neethling of the Melktert Kommissie, followed by Janie Bay and finally Demi Lee Moore. KWV, the sponsor making the Picnic Sundays series possible, had a range of bubblies and wines to treat mums and dads alike. Picnic Sundays’ organiser, Belinda Erasmus, said the whole concert series takes place in the Lowveld Botanical Garden, however, due to another event already taking place there, this Sunday’s Mother’s Day Concert was held at Arch & Arrow.

Even a jumping castle was made available for the children. “With the beautiful venue and all it has to offer, we will definitely host more Picnic Sundays next to the dam,” said Erasmus. She said halfway through Janie Bay’s show, a storm suddenly came down, which surprised the guests and organisers.  “We managed to make a plan and AVS Hire did an amazing job to ensure the quality and safety of the performance – and those who stuck out the weather had an amazing time. “It was definitely a success. It has been a while since we last saw grandmas and mums dancing in the rain!” she said.
