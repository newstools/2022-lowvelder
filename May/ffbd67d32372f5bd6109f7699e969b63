Lowveld Moths and MOTH supporters gathered at the Garden of Remembrance on Sunday May 8 for the 95th anniversary of the Memorable Order of Tin Hats (MOTH). According to MOTH member Stuart Charlton, the order was formed to provide support to all veterans who had returned from conflict situations and were destitute. “All MOTH members have given service to their country and government of the time. They wrote a blank cheque giving their lives as payment for others, in the interest of freedom and democracy,” he said.
