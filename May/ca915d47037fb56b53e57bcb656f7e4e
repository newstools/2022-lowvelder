One of the nearby lodge owners said
vehicles and trucks were stuck in the mud on Saturday May 21, and had to make use of the Rietfontein/Rustenburg secondary road as an alternative. According to by-laws, trucks are not
allowed to drive on secondary roads.
The Badfontein community has seen an
improvement in the state of the road the past few months after the Reinhard Transport Group has stepped in to partly take over the maintenance,” said the lodge owner. The project to improve the R36 was
spearheaded by the Reinhard Transport
Group in June 2021 under the direction of
Rodney Housten-McMillan (chief operating officer.) A steering committee was formed last
year, which comprises representatives
from transport and mining companies,
communities, local businesses, the
Lydenburg/Mashishing Business Chamber and the provincial government.  Hilton Philpot of the steering committee
said the truck and superlink trailers
transport chrome ore, ferrochrome and
sometimes iron-rich products on these
roads from the mines located in the east of the country, to rail and shipping nodes for onward transport to markets in Asia and Europe.  He indicated that these district roads were designed and constructed at a time when such enormous volumes of heavy commercial traffic were never envisaged. Ongoing heavy usage and rainy weather
resulted in deterioration of the recent
repairs and it is recognised that an ongoing maintenance programme will be necessary.
