Brendan McLaren and Kim Middleton, instructors of the Rosemarie Middleton Dance Academy, gave the demonstration during a school break. The high school reached out to the academy’s director, Rosemarie Middleton, because they are interested in teaching the learners social dancing. “The learners will be taught the basics of many dance genres like the waltz, cha-cha and what is commonly known as the ‘sokkie’. It will take place at the boy’s hostel, De Souza House. It is after school and will be an early evening extracurricular activity. We are not taking away from the winter sports practice times,” said Middleton. Middelton said they reached out to the school to host the classes. Teachers Franco Krause and his wife also danced for the learners at the demonstration and the learners enjoyed it very much. For more information, phone her on 082 330 2155.
