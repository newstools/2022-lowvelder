The second round of the Mpumalanga Enduro Race will take place.
Mountain bikers can choose between a full (23km) or light (13km) enduro race and can enter online till Thursday May 5 at 12:00.
The organisers said they welcome riders with different skill sets to join them. This series is designed to show that enduro rides are not “too difficult or technical”. The light version of the enduro is where newbies and children alike are invited to get their feet wet in the format of enduro and it is a non-competitive open class.
