He was adamant that he will continue with his passion for trail running. His doctors predicted that he will be able to compete again with proper precautions and monitoring. On Saturday May 17 Mabuza competed in the Recce Raid 2022 trail run in Dullstroom. He was proud to come home and show his employers and friends at JamJar Restuarant the silver medal he had won. Mabuza is the friendly security guard on the premises. He was the second adult male winner with a time of 1:09:03. Franco Oosthuizen won the gold medal in a time of 1:04:45. “I especially want to thank Dave Hinton and my managers at JamJar. I was looking forward to the race. After I was diagnosed with epilepsy, I didn’t think I would be able to do long-distance or do trail running again. At one stage I competed a few times a month,” said Mabuza. He said epilepsy will never rule his life. “I have been in and out of hospitals for the past year and have only been training again for the past three months. God performed a miracle at the race and He was with me every step of the way. Thank you to my coach, Charlie Naudé, who believes in me and offers up his time to train me,” said Mabuza.
