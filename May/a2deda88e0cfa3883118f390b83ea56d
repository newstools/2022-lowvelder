This was reportedly facilitated by home affairs officials after hours. The South African citizens were allegedly paid R500 each for the use of their information. The arrested five appeared in the White River Magistrate’s Court on May 20. The case was postponed to May 25 for a formal bail application. The suspects were remanded in custody and more arrests are expected as investigations continue.
