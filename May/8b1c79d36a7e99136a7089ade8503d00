Organisers are already making plans for the next Rooikat Liquors ladies’ night next year following a sold-out event full of fun and dancing on Saturday night, May 7. Held at the popular Mustangs – The Dancing Place, the doors opened at 16:00 for the Lowveld’s lovely ladies, offering a large variety of alcohol from gin and champagne, to vodka and much more. By 17:30, the venue was buzzing with women of all ages, some dressing up in feather boas, cowgirl hats, cat ear headbands and even mermaid-themed headbands.
