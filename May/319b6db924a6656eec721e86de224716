Religion and astronomy were interwoven at Church Unlimited on Sunday evening during world-renowned astronomer Prof David Block’s presentation. Block walked attendees through various universal phenomena (which he has studied extensively) and tied them back to the Bible. During his presentation he also shared various images of different galaxies leaving those in attendance in awe.  He said God is an artist and loves to design, pointing to the fact that from birds to galaxies, there is one Designer.

He jokingly referred to himself as a stellar gyneacologist, due to the fact that he studies the birth of stars. The professor has written many books and published scores of academic articles in the world’s top scientific journals. Before Sunday, Block had another presentation aimed at the youth talking about his journey through life with astronomy and faith. Church Unlimited’s expansive new building with the latest sound and media equipment complemented the professor’s presentation excellently. Do you have more information about the story?
