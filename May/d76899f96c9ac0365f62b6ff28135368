The P9/1 (R532), also known as the Sabie/Graskop Road, will remain closed until Saturday May 7 due to the unstable conditions at a sinkhole site following rock blasting that occurred yesterday, May 5.  The spokesperson for the provincial Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, Bongani Dhlamini, said the planned road closure on the P9/1 (R532) between Graskop and Sabie commenced on Thursday so that rock-blasting activities could be conducted as part of a sinkhole rehabilitation on-site.

The contractor is doing everything in its power to expedite these works and is expecting the temporary deviation to be reopened by Saturday before 12:00,” Dhlamini said. He urged road users from Mbombela/White River to travel via Hazyview to Sabie/Graskop to ease the traffic flow on the bypass.
