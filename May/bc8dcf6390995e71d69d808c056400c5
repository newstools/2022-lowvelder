After recent unsatisfactory results, Sekhukhune United have seen a need to bolster their coaching department.
Babina Noko have confirmed the appointment of Owen Da Gama as the club’s new co-coach for the remainder of the season. Da Gama is serving alongside incumbent head coach MacDonald Makhubedu. The veteran tactician, who was most recently in charge of fellow DStv Premiership side TS Galaxy, has joined the team on a deal that will run until the end of the 2021/22 campaign. “Da Gama has been part of South African football history for many years, and has also won the Telkom Knockout Cup in 2006,” Sekhukhune United’s chairperson, Simon Malatji, said in a statement.
“As Sekhukhune United, we are particularly keen to appoint South African coaches, and we express our commitment and confidence in the talent and ability of our local coaches.” Da Gama joins Babina Noko at a time when the club have won just one of their last 12 league outings and occupy 10th position in the log table with four matches remaining. The new coach was on the touchline when Sekhukhune drew 0-0 against Lamontville Golden Arrows on Saturday.
