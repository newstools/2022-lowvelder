Kwetse Primary of Bushbuckridge Local Municipality has been struggling with poor toilet facilities and the lack of running water for a very long time now. Sometimes it has forced the teachers and learners to leave the school premises to use other toilet facilities.  “We have been struggling with toilets for the past 15 years. Previously, the learners had to go to the bush to relieve themselves and it was not safe for them. We used to have 12 pit toilets that were almost unusable, but they couldn’t accommodate all the learners anyhow,” said the principal, Morris Mokoena.

When the opportunity to help the school finally arose, no time was wasted as the department finally finished with what they had promised. Kwetse Primary not only received suitable toilet facilities, but also a borehole that easily fills up a water tank with a 10 000-litre capacity. “We experience very hot weather here at Kwetse Primary, but we are grateful for the department who gave us water to drink, to flush our toilets and to wash our hands,” said Mokoena.
