The White River Ratepayers and Residents Association (WRRRA) gave a collective thumbs-down to the proposed residential development of 200 houses in Kingsview, because of poor existing infrastructure development.The vice chairperson of WRRRA, Pierre du Preez, said they are not supporting the building of these residential units, because it will put pressure on the struggling infrastructure. “We will only allow the development to go ahead if the infrastructure is upgraded, because it will negatively impact water, power, roads, the clinic and schools. This project was certainly fast-tracked by underhand operations and it was not considered where White River is situated. It is not poor planning from a town perspective, but a corrupt one. There was no public participation and no proper impact studies were done,” he said.

This is the first step in exercising land use rights on a property. Once approved, building plans may be considered. “The township establishment process ensures that services are provided for the proposed development in that township. The proclamation of Kingsview Extension 1 and the subsequent transfer of the erfs in the township are an indication that services for the erven in the township have been planned for and provided as this process is inclusive of all service delivery departments in the city,” he said.
