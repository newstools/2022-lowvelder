Originally conceptualised in 2006, the Greater Riverside Biodiversity Initiative (GRBI) aims to conserve and preserve the green spaces in and around the greater Riverside precinct and open them up for everyone to enjoy. These spaces will increase the city’s resilience to climate change, conserve and enhance biodiversity value and generate opportunities for true social and ecological regeneration through the establishment of sustainable and catalytic green spaces within the existing greater Riverside greenbelt. The two major rivers running through the greenbelt, the Crocodile and Nels rivers, the botanical garden anchoring the area, and a number of wetlands, riverine and sensitive environmental areas, truly make this area a real green gem that is simply waiting to be polished and shown off.  A non-profit company has been set up to be the custodian and managers of the GRBI and the associated green areas and an interim steering committee consisting of environmental experts and representatives from the City of Mbombela, Halls Properties, the University of Mpumalanga, the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and Environmental Affairs and Sanbi have been constituted to oversee the establishment of the NPC, its planning and implementation. In celebration of Biodiversity Day on May 22, and through the mobilisation of resources, the commencement of phase one, which entails the removal of alien vegetation and cleaning up of riverine areas in the north of the precinct, has begun. All parties involved are excited to deliver a space that speaks to the collective vision.
