The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) disrupted Estralita Special School by locking learners and some employees inside the school premises. The educators were not allowed entry. According to social media posts, there are allegations of racism at the school. The person who led the Nehawu protesters is not an Estralita employee. The Nehawu members included educators, housekeepers, cleaners, kitchen staff and groundsmen. A parent who was standing outside the locked premises told Steelburger/Lydenburg News she was concerned about the learners.  “We are so upset. Some of these children can’t even go to the bathroom on their own. Some take medication on a daily basis and are used to a strict schedule,” said the parent. The Lydenburg SAPS and Sun Security were on the scene. Classes were suspended by Tumelo Mokwena, Mashishing Circuit manager of the Mpumalanga Department of Education. Some educators did return to the school later.  Plans were being made to prepare meals for the learners who reside at the school’s boarding facilities. The parents of the day-to-day pupils were asked to collect them. Estralita Special School and the Mpumalanga Department of Education said a press release will be issued after all parties have been consulted. The newspaper will keep its readers informed as soon as more information becomes available.
