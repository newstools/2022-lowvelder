The National Prosecuting Authority welcomed the sentence imposed on three illegal poachers handed down by the Skukuza Regional Court. Isaiah Zitha (41), Oscar Ndlovu (38) and Richard Mkhonto (39), pleaded guilty to the crimes and were subsequently convicted of trespassing, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, illegal hunting in a park, possession of ammunition, killing of a rhino and possession of an axe. These crimes occurred in two separate incidents.

They were linked to the offence with DNA taken from the carcass. They appeared in court and received bail. Zitha absconded after his bail was received. He was rearrested with his two accomplices on May 12, 2018 in the Kingfisherspruit section of the Kruger by rangers after they had followed the tracks. The trio was charged with poaching-related offences, hence their conviction and sentence.
