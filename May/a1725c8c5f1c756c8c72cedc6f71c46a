A water fun day, a movie night, concerts packed with dancing and singing and an outdoor festival were just some of the festivities in store for Laerskool Laeveld’s 40th birthday celebrations last week. Tuesday was the first day of the school’s celebrations. The pupils and teachers came to school wearing white T-shirts. The theme for the day was “verf dit rooi”, and soon the flood of white T-shirts became red.

However, some of the teachers also joined in the fun and snuck a few turns on the slides. On Thursday evening, the school held its 40th birthday concert, during which both pupils and teachers put on a play to hits from both the ’80s and the ’90s. On Friday, there was a movie night on the schoolground, with the R60 ticket including popcorn and soft drinks.
