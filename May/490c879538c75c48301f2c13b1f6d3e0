Visitors and locals enjoyed the Portuguese Festa at the Catholic Church on Sunday. Festivalgoers swarmed in when the gates opened at 09:00. By 12:00, the streets and sidewalks were packed with vehicles.  The attendees explored the Portuguese culture, the tastiest traditional meals, refreshing drinks, live music and cultural dance performances. Face painting, a water slide and jumping castles were organised for the children while the parents enjoyed the event with family and friends.

A Portuguese group, the Rancho Folclorico Da Casa Social da Madeira Club of Pretoria, were the main entertainment of the day. They performed traditional dances wearing cultural uniforms. The Portuguese Festa started in 2004 as a fundraising event for the Catholic Church, celebrating the rich culture of the Portuguese people.  “It was a huge success and the numbers keep growing each year. All our food was sold out in three hours! We would like to thank the Lowveld community for attending and supporting the event. Without them, this could have not taken place. May we see everybody and more at the festa next year,” said Inês de Abreu, the coordinator.
