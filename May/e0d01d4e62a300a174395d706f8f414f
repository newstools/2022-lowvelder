Raising awareness for lady bikers, around 60 riders from clubs across the Lowveld took part in the annual International Female Ride Day on Saturday May 7. Organised by the Ladies of Harley, under the Big 5 Chapter, the riders met at 08:00 at Eastview Motorad. From there, the group, supported by around 20 marshals, embarked at 09:00 on a bike ride through Mbombela to raise awareness in the community that women bike riders exist and that they, too, have fun riding motorbikes. The representative of Ladies of Harley, Natachia Freeman, said the ride is an annual event around the world.
