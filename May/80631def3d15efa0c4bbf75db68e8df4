SEKHUKHUNE – The Limpopo Department of Basic Education has announced its intention to rationalise
389 non-viable schools in the province last week. This means that 344 of the 389 schools will be merged, while the remaining 45 will be closed for good. This is the  fourth time that the department has rationalised schools in Limpopo. Previously, mergers have been initiated three times: in 2008, 2013 and 2017. Addressing education stakeholders in Polokwane, the MEC for education, Polly Boshielo, said, “Our engagement today and beyond on our intention to rationalise schools, must be viewed as taking the responsibility of ensuring that we invest in the education of our children to afford them the opportunity to excel on the world stage.” Boshielo called for serious cooperation and collaboration to ensure that the depart-ment works with stakeholders to reorganise schools to increase efficiency and reduce waste. The list of schools to be rationalised will be published soon. The department will carry out public consultations and stakeholders have 90 days to give their input.
