The provincial police spokesperson, Col Donald Mdluli, said two men were driving in a silver-grey VW Polo towards Malalane and offered a lift to a man who was hitch-hiking at Valencia. “Along the way they diverted to Croc Valley where one of them drew a knife in an attempt to rob the man who was given a lift.
The man drew his firearm and allegedly shot both men. One died at the scene and the other died while he was being transported to hospital. The two are yet to be identified,” he said.

Provincial commissioner of the SAPS in Mpumalanga Lt Gen Lt Daphney Manamela urged people to refrain from asking for lifts and rather use safe modes of transport to reach their destinations.
