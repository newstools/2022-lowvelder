A bus transporting about 100 learners was involved in an accident on the R40 near Da Gama Dam outside White River. Medical personnel and law enforcement officers are on the scene. Moeti Mmusi, the spokesperson for the Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, said the road will be closed for about four hours.  “No fatalities have been reported. We are, however, unable to confirm if the pupils’ injuries are minor or major.”
Mmusi said according to the information received, the accident had only involved the bus. “From the report we received the driver lost control of the bus after he had tried to avoid causing an accident. It is unclear if it was a car or an object that he had swerved to avoid.” ALSO READ: Police find body of six-year-old girl According to him, motorists should use an alternative road. “Motorists and everyone going to and from Hazyview, White River and Mbombela should use the R538.
