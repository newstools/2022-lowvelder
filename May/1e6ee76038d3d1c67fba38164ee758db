The choir of Lowveld High School has asked the community for its support in a fundraiser it will be hosting on May 30. These talented singers will be at Salsa Mexican Grill in i’langa Mall from 15:30. All you need to do is invite friends and family, order, enjoy and pay for your meal, and Salsa will do the rest by donating a percentage of the evening’s income to the choir. The full choir will perform from 15:30 to15:45 followed by solo performances from 16:30 to 17:00, and again from 18:30 to 19:00.
