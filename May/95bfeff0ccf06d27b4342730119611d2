MECKLENBURG – A 29-year-old security officer appeared in the Mecklenburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. He was charged with murder and attempted murder. His case was postponed to June 2 for legal representation. He was not granted bail. The suspect was arrested on May 22 for allegedly murdering a 22-year-old woman, believed
to be his girlfriend, and attempting to kill her three-year-old son in Driekop in March. “On Saturday March 26, the body of a woman with multiple stab wounds was found in the bush next to Mamphahlane Village under the Driekop policing precinct.
“This after a badly injured and bleeding boy was met by the residents in the area, and when asked what had happened, he led them to the spot where his mother was lying. The police were called,” revealed Limpopo SAPS spokesman, Brig Motlafelo Mojapelo. The police opened a case of murder and attempted murder and a manhunt for the suspect immediately commenced. “Preliminary investigations indicated that the suspect had stabbed both the women and her son. The boy apparently regained consciousness and was able to raise alarm,” said Mojapelo. He said the deceased has now been identified as Fezile Qhawe Nxumalo from KwaZulu-Natal. She was earlier reported missing at Witbank Police Station by her family. A well-coordinated investigation conducted by the Witbank police in collaboration with investigators from Driekop Police Station, led to the arrest of the suspect. The Limpopo police commissioner, Lt Gen Thembi Hadebe, has lauded these investigations that started with a missing person’s report at Witbank Police Station and subsequently led to the arrest of the suspect. “As we continue the fight against gender-based violence and femicide, this arrest will bring a certain level of solace to the affected family, even though it will not bring back their loved ones. It will also send a clear message to other perpetrators of these horrendous crimes that the police will be relentless in pursuit of justice.”
