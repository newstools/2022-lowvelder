The roadworks in Koraalboom Avenue have restarted after a two-year standstill. The spokesperson for Independent Development Trust (IDT), Phasha Mokogolane, said they have instructed the contractor, Thenjwa Engineering and Projects (TEP), to start with work, prioritising the closing of the two ditches that stretch across the road near the traffic circle.

It is expected that the work will be completed in two weeks’ time. However, it is expected that the rain will hamper the progress. We have made it clear to the contractor that they must prioritise cleaning the area and closing the ditches,” Mokogolane said.  He appealed to the community to be patient while the roadworks are in progress.
