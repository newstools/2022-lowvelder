Marius Opperman and Charl Viljoen cleaned the park across from the Thaba Chweu Disaster Centre.
The residents of Ext 2 have been living next to what can only be described as a sewage pool, which has been leaking into the Dorps River flowing through town. This sewerage pool is close to the park and Lydenburg Primary.
“The water treatment plant in Extension 2 is only one of the issues in the area. We hope by cleaning the park it will be an example for residents to also clean their own streets to make a difference in the community,” said Opperman. Opperman, the DA councillor of Ward 14, wanted to thank everyone who came to help.
