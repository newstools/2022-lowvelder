As a celebration of the existing Yoons Eatery and the start of a new venture for the restaurant, Yoons @ Barnyard opened its doors on Sunday. Yoons Eatery opened its doors at White River Crossing two years ago on March 6. The owner, Unice-Ann Badenhorst, thought this the appropriate day to host the grand opening of Yoons @ Barnyard. It also happened to be her husband Calvyn’s birthday. The decision came with the realisation that Yoons Eatery simply did not have the capacity that Badenhorst wanted for live events. “The capacity just became too small, and this is such a lovely area. I have a love of shows, people and music; I just needed a space to put it all together.” The choice of artist also once again ties in Yoons Eatery. Arno Carstens was the first live show ever hosted there. Badenhorst thus chose him again to mark this new venture’s first of many shows. Opening for him was a local, Tessi Nandi. Carstens even remarked that he would like to sing a song with her one day.

Prior to the ribbon cutting ceremony, the Casterbridge Music Development Academy’s marimba band also kept the crowd entertained. All in all, Badenhorst said the day turned out exactly like she wanted. A comfortable space was created where all are welcome, including children and dogs. Next on the menu is Martin Bester on March 25 followed by Majozi on April 1 and 2.
