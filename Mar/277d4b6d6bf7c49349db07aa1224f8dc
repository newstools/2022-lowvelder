SEKHUKHUNE – The ongoing, weekly, joint operations conducted by the Limpopo SAPS saw 1 397 suspects arrested.
The operations targeted all crime-infested areas. The arrested suspects were between the ages of 19 and 55, including a 29-year-old alleged bogus doctor.
The “doctor” was arrested by the Provincial Tracking Team in Mankweng on Monday morning, after receiving information about a man who was swindling money from unsuspecting female victims in Polokwane, Mankweng, Sekhukhune, Botlokwa and Senwabarwana. “A case of theft under false pretenses was opened after he allegedly swindled about R40 000 from female victims. The suspect, who was reportedly driving around in a BMW X5, at times allegedly disguised himself as an evangelist. The BMW was also seized. He is expected to appear in court soon. The police are making an appeal to anyone who might have fallen victim to this bogus doctor to come forward to assist in the unfolding investigations,” said Limpopo SAPS spokesman, Brig Motlafelo Mojapelo. In Matlekereng, a 27-year-old suspect was arrested for dealing in heroin on Sunday. Information was received that the suspect was on his way to KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga to collect the drugs. The members of Matlekereng Crime Prevention Unit and detectives, with the assistance of Mpumalanga Security Intelligence, swiftly reacted and arrested the suspect and recovered 100 pinches of heroin. Mojapelo said other suspects were arrested for various crimes including murder, attempted murder, robbery, assault, malicious damage to property, rape, sexual assault, arson, fraud, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, and dealing in drugs and illicit cigarettes. A total of 161 firearms were recovered during these operations. Police also confiscated counterfeit cigarettes, dangerous weapons, dagga, crystal meth, nyaope, knives and four stolen vehicles. Limpopo SAPS acting commissioner, Maj Gen Jan Scheepers, lauded the successes reached during these operations.
