An exhibition at the White River Gallery, titled “Through the Fire”, will take onlookers on a journey through the lives and hardships of two artists. Odette Saayman’s portraits and artworks, inspired by her journey with cancer, are complemented by featured ceramic works by Annalie Odendaal. It could be said that the two artists’ works meet each other in the middle with the subjects they touch on. With Saayman being a part of the White River community, she interacts with its people regularly. “As these individuals are very near and dear to my heart, they feature strongly in this exhibition.” Saayman said she was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2021. This signalled the beginning of a long journey of tests, chemotherapy treatments, a mastectomy, rehabilitation exercises and radiation treatments, all while dealing with Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns.Needless to say, this also features strongly.

Art gave me back a piece of myself.  “I have decided to share my uniquely personal experiences in this regard, in the hope that others with similar battles will find comfort and strength in the knowledge that they are not alone.” Odendaal in turn said the exhibition took her on an unexpected journey that touched her very deeply. “Exploring barrel firing, I pondered about life, death, the Earth and living, and reached the conclusion that the unforeseen tales of our lives either leave us shattered, cracked, or improved.”  The exhibition officially opened on March 12 and will conclude on April 4. The artists did their walkabouts this past weekend. Gallery hours are from 10:00 to 16:00 on weekdays, and 10:00 to 14:00 on weekends and public holidays.
