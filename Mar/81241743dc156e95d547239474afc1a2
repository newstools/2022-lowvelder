Lowveld High School’s choir conductor, Bongani Mavundla, deemed his choir’s fundraiser at Panarottis a “great success”. Some of the choir members took “centre stage” at this i’langa Mall restaurant on Monday afternoon thought to the evening. “I think the most important thing is that those kids did really well. The attendance was amazing in the evening, with not just only parents; some patrons of Panarottis were also there in full support and enjoyed the evening, short programme as it was.” He said they were both well supported and received good feedback from the community. From a financial point of view, Mavundla said they are still waiting to hear how much money was raised. “In itself, the event was a great success, considering the children were not coached; they picked their own songs, did their own thing. We were just really there to support them.” ALSO READ: IN PHOTOS: BUCO Nelspruit hosts Ryobi Truck (Yard) Sale
