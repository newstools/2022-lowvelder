A lucky few Lowveld talents have the opportunity of a lifetime coming up in July – the IMTA 2022 New York. Wandisa Simelane is one of them. This big city convention, hosted by the IMTA (International Modeling and Talent Association), is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for hopeful young models, actors, singers and dancers to show international scouts (more than 300 of them) what they have to offer. It will consist of 10 days of competitions across these various sections. Naturally, this comes at a cost.
