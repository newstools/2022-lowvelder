The Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM) has confirmed that the road to the landfill site is inaccessible. Gardening services and refuse removal companies said that they are forced to dump refuse and garden rubble in open areas or empty plots in town. The road deteriorated due to continued heavy rain during the past week.  T “The recent heavy rains have made access to the Lydenburg landfill site difficult, especially for light vehicles, due to slippery conditions. Normal operations are ongoing. Residents with light vehicles are disposing of waste on their way to the site and are not able to drive to the site. We urge them to wait till the road is graded early next week,” said Themba Sibiya, communication and marketing manager TCLM. “Dumping in town is the last thing I want to do. But the road to the landfill site is inaccessible,” complained the gardening service owner. The owner said that she has to drive to the landfill site at least five to six times a day and she can’t store the refuse for a few days somewhere.
