They feel strongly about a holistic approach to maintaining the human body. That is why they are so excited to welcome a new physiotherapist, Tebogo Manasoe, who has extensive knowledge of sports injuries, to the team. Manasoe is no stranger to academia and started her career with a diploma in administration. A degree in sports management followed after hard work, and she did not stop there. The pursuit of this career change came about when she gained experience in basic rehabilitation while working in the gym environment. The next degree on her agenda was physiotherapy. Manasoe is originally from Polokwane, but is pleased to settle in Lydenburg. Physiotherapist Joey van der Merwe was born and raised in Lydenburg, and is a proud alumnus of Laerskool Lydenburg. Manasoe will be working alongside her to benefit from Van der Merwe’s 24 years of experience as a physiotherapist. She and the practice are excited to welcome Manasoe to the team.  The practice was established in 2007 at the Swembad Centre, after which it relocated. Also joining the team is Retha Oppermann, originally from Stellenbosch. She will work alongside Peggy Jansen (a local resident and Van der Merwe’s sister), to make appointments, receive patients with a friendly smile, and handle all administrative issues. Physiotherapy treats a variety of condtions, from back and neck pain, sports injuries, acute injuries of all joints and post-operative conditions, to lung conditions such as bronchitis, pneumonia and post-Covid lung issues. Dry needling as a treatment is also available for those patients who prefer it. Their advice is to not wait until the pain becomes debilitating and interferes with your daily functioning. Contact Van der Merwe and Associates Physiotherapy on 013 235 0001 or 073 450 4351 to make an appointment.
