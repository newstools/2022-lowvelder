A group of abogogo is making huge strides in Mashishing and Lydenburg.
During a visit to the Steelburger/Lydenburg News offices on Wednesday March 23, the Widows Spiritual Support Group proudly modelled their new golf shirts. At the end of 2021, the Gopher Charity Golf Fund sponsored these shirts for the ladies, and they are proudly wearing them. They also wanted to thank Bruce James, the Gophers’ chairperson, for the donation. Fifty of the ladies wore their new shirts to an event hosted by Makhosazane Masilela at the Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature last week. “The Speaker complimented us on our appearance and said it was heart-warming we started a group to support widows. We are just back from praying for one of our members who had a death in the family. That is our main purpose, providing food for people who can’t cook for themselves anymore and praying for each other. Never forget the power of prayer,” said Rev Anna Williams. She is the pastor at the St Anglican Church in Mashishing. Williams became a widow at the tender age of 31 and raised her three daughters alone. She is currently registered for a doctorate in theology. In 2014, she was ordained as a deacon in the Anglican Church and as a priest in 2016. “God revealed the vision to start this group in 2015 to fulfil this vision for widows,” said Williams.
