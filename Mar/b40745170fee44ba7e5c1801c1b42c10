A provincial police spokesperson, Brig Selvy Mohlala, said that at around 22:00, two field rangers were camping around the area at Sabi Sands Private Game Reserve in Skukuza when they spotted two suspected poachers carrying firearms. “The field rangers approached the suspects and instructed them to stop. However, one suspect fled, but his fellow surrendered and was captured by the rangers. The male suspect was found with a hunting rifle, eight live rounds, a knife, a backpack with foodstuffs and a silencer in his possession,” said Mohlala.
