Church Unlimited had moved around Mbombela several times before finally settling permanently just off the Barberton Road in 2005. According to one of the pastors, Etienne Garnett-Bennett, the plans to enlarge the building complex started five years ago. “As funds came in, we continued building and we are grateful to have finished the new additions to the building in December,” he said. “The church can now seat around 1 500 people, but due to Covid regulations, the seating is at half its capacity, so there are about 750 to 800 people in the church today (February 26).” ALSO READ: UPDATE: Grandson appears in Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court for grandmother’s murder The church hopes to also make the facility available to the community to use for concerts, events, graduations and various other functions. “It is something we want to share.
