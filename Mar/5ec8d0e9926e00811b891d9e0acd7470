After three people were killed while crossing the R40 in the last two months, the KLCBT has proposed a pedestrian bridge be constructed over it. According to the chamber’s chairperson, TJ Maré, a bridge would save lives. The area of concern is from the Crossing Shopping Centre to Riverside. Maré said there are new developments at the old showgrounds. With new businesses opening, the number of people crossing the R40 in that area will intensify.
