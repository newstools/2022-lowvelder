The male rhino calf was born between 05:00 and 05:30 on the morning of March 1 at Care for Wild a mere two weeks after the sanctuary’s first ever calf born to two orphans. Care for Wild described it as another incredibly poignant and emotional moment for the team. The new mother, River, was rescued on September 4, 2014, after poachers had killed her mother. River was attacked by lions that had left deep wounds on her thighs. Although River’s wounds healed, she still bears the scars, a continual reminder of her fight for survival, said the sanctuary.

Fiercely protective of her crash and rhino friends, this instinct to protect is more prevalent now than ever before. One thing is certain, this little one has an amazing mum!” The female calf born to Wyntir has been named Blizzy. “She was named in honour of her mother and father and the incredible journeys they have been on. What do you call a winter’s storm? A blizzard,” said the sanctuary about the little rhino’s chosen name. The latest addition to the Care for Wild family has yet to receive his name, but the sanctuary will be providing updates soon. When the first calf was born, the sanctuary’s founder, Petronel Nieuwoudt, said, “I look at both Wyntir and Storm (Blizzy’s dad) and all in one moment I see their whole journey. Every second of struggle, every hour of effort, every sacrifice and every person who gave everything to save them.

She is hope for the species and for humanity. Rhinos belong to the world and it is all of our responsibility to save them.”
