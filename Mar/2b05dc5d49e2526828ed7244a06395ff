A 6km-trail run that kicked off on Saturday (19 February) at 06:00, marked the first combined charity event between the White River SPCA and White River Hospice. Although the morning was slightly cooler and a little wet, the 59 runners did not lack the necessary enthusiasm. The manager of hospice, Terran Gericke, said the day turned out to be fun with the local community that came together to show their support for the the charities. Estelle de Villiers, the chairperson of the SPCA, said the venue, The Wild Fig Estate, was beautiful and provided a tough trail. While marking out the course, André Vianello and Clive Smart remarked that it was nothing really technical, just sand roads, rocky patches, cut grass, bush tunnels, tree lined paths and open grassy plains – all the things a good trail run should have; oh, and animals.

Many a household from The Wild Fig Estate also donated their R100, even though they never even participated.  “We thank them all for the generosity. Vanessa Price and her team for making a halfway house refreshment stop; it was much appreciated. A great day all round.” Both Gericke and De Villiers agreed that they would definitely band together again in the future to raise funds for their respective organisations.
