BURGERSFORT – A petrol attendant has prevented severe fire damage at Temba Filling Station’s Barcelos Restaurant – not all heroes wear capes after all. Donald Mashoto Riba utilised his firefighting skills when a fire started at the restaurant on Tuesday. Riba went above and beyond his duties in keeping the fire away from critical areas, until help could arrive. “If not for his brave actions and quick thinking, we would have had much more damage to our site. We are thankful to have people of Riba’s skills at Temba,” said Divan du Plessis, the manager of the filling station.
He added, “The fast actions of friends and colleagues assisted us in a time we had a great need. We would like to thank Hi-Q, Protect Security and National Guarding Security for their fast response and all their efforts to keep the fire from spreading. “We would also like to give a big thank you to the Tubatse Fire Department and their team for the really fast response time and the fact that they were really prepared, professional and managed the task at hand perfectly. Temba’s management said they were relieved that no injuries were reported during the fire.
