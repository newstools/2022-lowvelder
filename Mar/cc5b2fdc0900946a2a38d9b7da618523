On Saturday February 26, Riverside Precinct held its first event of the year: the Love in the Lowveld Night Market. Hosted in the pristine setting of the Southern Sun Emnotweni Gardens, Love in the Lowveld Night Market was deemed a hit by its organisers. Over 30 traders set up their wonderful stalls and began trading with great excitement.  “We were very pleased with the attendance and participation from both the public and the traders. Our hope is that by hosting events of this kind, we will give local Lowvelders the opportunity to sell their arts and crafts,” said Jessica Prim, Riverside Precinct’s marketing coordinator. The event catered for everyone. Zippy the Clown entertained the kids with face painting and balloon sculptures. The crowd was treated to performances by Danny’s Angels and the legendary saxophonist, Khangi.
