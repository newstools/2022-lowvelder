The woman is not off the hook yet. However, when she was taken to Bushbuckridge Magistrate’s Court on the same day for her appearance, she was confirmed as the mother, but the case was not enrolled, pending investigation. The child is still in the hospital where she is being monitored while the probe continues,” said Mohlala. The provincial police commissioner, Lt Gen Semakaleng Manamela, has strongly condemned this incident, and made a call to society for moral regeneration. “We believe it is paramount for families, traditional leaders and spiritual leaders to assist in restoring the moral fibre of our society,” she said.
