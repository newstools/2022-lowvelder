The 26-year-old, who had allegedly defrauded some community members in Sekhukhune and Capricorn districts through social media, was arrested last Wednesday in the Mall of the North after intensive investigations by the Limpopo SAPS. According to the SAPS, the suspect had been scamming residents through social media platforms since 2021. “The suspect reportedly advertised his business of selling concrete slabs through social media, claiming that he was the owner and CEO of ‘MKP Concrete Rib and Block Slab PTY LTD’. He would request a 50% deposit from his victims before he delivered, and then, after receiving the deposit, he would disappear,” said the spokesperson for the Limpopo SAPS, Brig Motlafelo Mojapelo. In one of the cases reported at Mecklenburg, he had allegedly defrauded his victim of an amount of R57 000, which was transferred directly into his bank account, after which he failed to deliver the promised material. The cases were reported to Mankweng, Mecklenburg and other policing areas, as well as other parts of the province in which he had allegedly defrauded some victims of an estimated amount of over a million rand. Mojapelo said community members across the province are required to come forward and report to the police if they were somehow defrauded by this suspect. He said the suspect would soon appear in the local magistrate’s court to face charges of fraud.
The acting provincial police commissioner, Maj Gen Jan Scheepers, has appealed to anyone with information that may assist the SAPS investigations, to contact the provincial head of commercial crime, Brig Frans Ramokolo, on 071 481 2944, or the Crime Stop number, 08600 10111. Alternatively, visit the nearest police station or use the My SAPS app. Police investigations are continuing.
