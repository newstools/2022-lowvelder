With the help of Ligwalagwala FM and a Good Samaritan, Ralph Mphangane Kamarongwane, a new wheelchair was donated to Ndlovu on March 4. Ndlovu had no money for one and could not afford to fix the broken one he had used for years. “Having a broken wheelchair that cannot fold up caused many problems for Bheki. Taxi drivers always refused to stop for him and when they did, they got aggressive for having to deal with him,” said Shabangu.
