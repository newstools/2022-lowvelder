In less than two weeks, road spikes as well as various purpose-specific objects to slow down vehicles that use the N4, have been picked up by truck drivers who fell victim to the traps. The police have been observing all dangerous car-stopping tools that were collected by road users and have informed the public and tourists to be extra careful when driving on the road from Malalane to Komatipoort, especially at night.

It is unclear whether the motive is robbery or destructive malice,” said Alwin Carstens from Nkomazi Security Solutions. According to Carstens, when a driver comes across road spikes or drives over one, the first course of action would be to slow down and keep driving to the nearest police or filling station, where you as driver are certain that people will be in the area. Be aware of your surroundings before coming to a complete stop or getting out of your vehicle and inform someone of your location immediately.
