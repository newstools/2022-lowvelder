It all started when Café Crust owner André du Preez asked wine marketer Toiné Schoeman why Lydenburg could not have its own wine show. Schoeman, the owner of Varietals and organiser of the popular Unwined and other wine shows, obliged on Saturday March 5. More than 70 wine lovers from Lydenburg and surrounds attended this fun-filled day. A mere R150 bought a mini-tour of some of the Cape Winelands’ prime estates, offering a tasting of more than 20 different wines. Each stall hosted two estates, well represented by Schoeman’s Varietals team. Lydenburg’s wine enthusiasts were introduced to well-known names like Hermanuspietersfontein, Groote Post, Morgenster, Vrede en Lust and Vergenoegd Löw estate wines. The father-and-daughter duo of Dullstroom, Alwin and Stella van Niekerk, and their Gem & I-band added to the day’s ambience, with Nicolene Breytenbach singing along on request. The resounding feedback from participants was that this event should be repeated shortly. In the meantime, Café Crust will be adding many of these wines to their new wine list.
