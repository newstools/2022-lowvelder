It was a day of back-breaking yet rewarding work for members of the Claremeont community when they took it into their own hands to clear the Uitkyk Road of overgrown bushes and trees on Saturday March 12. Members of the Claremont community policing forum (CPF) as well as a few members of the public headed out to the Uitkyk Road at 07:30 on Saturday, starting their clean-up at The Rest turn-off. A CPF member, Belinda Keun, said the clean-up was a community initiative under the Our Mbombela movement, and was organised by CPF chair, André Keun.

With all the bushes and trees growing over into the road, it is dangerous for these activities. We also want drivers to have a clear vision of the road and be able to see around bends without any trees obscuring the view,” she said. Belinda said they had had help from KCS Internet Services, Knight Fencing, Lowveld Waste and Refuse Services, and Vleis Paleis generously provided skips, brush cutters, vehicles to remove the refuse and petrol to assist with the clean-up.
