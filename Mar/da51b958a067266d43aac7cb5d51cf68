SEKHUKHUNE – Lt Col Moatshe Ngoepe is retiring from the SAPS. March 31 will be the last day Ngoepe reports for duty. Born in Taueatswala, a village next to Steilloop, Ngoepe joined the police service in 1985 and was promoted through the ranks until he became an officer in 1990, with the rank of lieutenant. A trained detective and communication practitioner, Ngoepe performed his tasks as if there were no tomorrow. True to his calling, first as a police officer and also as a detective, this member of the force successfully secured a number of life sentences in various crimes he had investigated. This was done during the 10-year period he had worked as a detective. The experience he acquired dealing with case dockets as an investigating officer, made him an astute communicator who fully understood and knew what to relay and what journalists from various media houses needed. In 2018, the former Limpopo provincial commissioner, Lt Gen Nneke Ledwaba, appreciated the dedication and loyalty Ngoepe had consistently shown, and promoted him to the rank of colonel and to the SAPS provincial commander of media relations. In his last interview with Steelburger/Lydenburg News, he indicated that he wished to enjoy his retirement with his family and grandchildren. “I have had 37 years uninterrupted service in the SAPS. For 27 years I had worked as a media liaison officer in the SAPS. Now is the time for me to go and rest on a full retirement pension from April 1.
“I have run my race by the mercy of the Almighty God. I will still be available in any advisory role for the SAPS.”
