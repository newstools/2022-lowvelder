The police seized more than three motorbikes and arrested five men in total on the N4, who had allegedly been trying to smuggle them into Mozambique on March 12. A provincial police spokesperson, Brig Selvy Mohlala, said, “The police received information about a white Toyota Quantum minibus with Free State registration plates. The minibus taxi was carrying suspected stolen items while en route to Mozambique on the N4. The said vehicle, which was occupied by commuters, was spotted by our members between KaNyamazane and Matsulu travelling in the direction of Malalane.
