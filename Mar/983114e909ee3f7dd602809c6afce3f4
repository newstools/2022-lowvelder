STEELPOORT – For the past 13 years, the residents of Ga-Mapodile township had no water. They relied on buying water from truckers in the community. On Friday, the Mapodile Water Committee confirmed to Steelburger/Lydenburg News that their water problems were a thing of the past.  “Our community had struggled with water since 2009. For years we had been reporting to both the local and district municipalities as well as the Lepelle Northern Water, which is a state-owned enterprise supplying bulk potable water in Limpopo, without any permanent solutions. “Our team worked day and night to ensure water is restored in this community,” said Khutso Ngake, member of the Mapodile Water Committee. He said the new committee had to remove illegal connections. “We also replaced a pump from our booster reservoir (pump station), which had been out of service for more than
three years. We had to repair the leaking pipeline, and all machineries are now fixed. Gone are the days in which we drank water from the rivers. We thank all the volunteers as well as businesses who assisted with equipment for restoring water,” said Ngake. He said the last time Mapodile residents had running water from the reticulation systems, was in 2009.
