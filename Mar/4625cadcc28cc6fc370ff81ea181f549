JANE FURSE -The ANC in Limpopo congratulated Minah Bahula and Pule Shayi on their election as members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the South African Local Government Association (Salga)
Salga recently held its two-day conference in Cape Town to vote for its leadership for this term of municipal councils. Bahula and Shayi are part of 12 new NEC members who will oversee the affairs of the organisation of South African municipalities for the next five years. “This leadership replaces the executive that was led by Thembi Nkadimeng, another product of the ANC Limpopo, whose meticulous leadership at Salga saw her becoming the co-president of the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and now serves as deputy minister of Cogta. “The election of Bahula and Shayi into this prestigious formation of municipalities is no coincidence as the two leaders have brought stability in their respective councils in this past term,” said the party spokesperson, Donald Selamolela
Under the leadership of Bahula, governance and financial management has been stabilised in the Makhuduthamaga Local Municipality (MLM). The MLM continues to provide decent services to its people, and is always able to spend on its municipal infrastructural grant (MIG). The two leaders also serve on the ANC regional structures. Bahula is the deputy regional chairperson of Sekhukhune Region and Shayi is the regional chairperson of Norman Mashabane Region. The ANC Limpopo wished the two leaders well during their tenure as Salga NEC members.
The party said it is hopeful that they will impart knowledge to their counterparts in the province, to improve the local government sector.
