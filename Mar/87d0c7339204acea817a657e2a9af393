Before he began his set, Lowvelder singer Lonita Swift warmed up the small crowd with well-known songs, including music by Abba and Shania Twain. Before Hofmeyr even set foot on stage, the restaurant was bustling with excitement. Welcomed by loud whistling and applause, the Afrikaans singer started his set. “The Lowveld is beautiful!” he said. This was met with hearty cheers from his fans. Hofmeyr sang an array of songs for his enthusiastic fans, from originals, such as “Engel noem”, to crowd favourite covers of popular Afrikaans and English music, such as “I love Rock ‘n Roll” by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and “Have You Ever Seen the Rain” by Creedance Clearwater Revival.
