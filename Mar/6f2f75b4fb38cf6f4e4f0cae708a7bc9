A man took his family to a nursery out on the Kaapsehoop Road this morning to purchase some items and returned to the parking area to find that their Toyota Hilux bakkie had been stolen. André Greeff, the owner of the bakkie, said he had only had this 2019 model for about four months now. They had arrived at Montana Garden & Pet Pavilion at around 10:15 to buy some goldfish.

Greeff proceeded to open a case with the SAPS and said security companies are also on the lookout. The manager of Montana, Stanley Greyling, said when Greeff had re-entered the premises to inform them that his vehicle had been stolen, he immediately assisted by providing the camera footage and contacting the authorities. Hi-Tech’s Callum mac Pherson said they had issued a warning to Toyota owners recently after a spike in vehicles being stolen.
