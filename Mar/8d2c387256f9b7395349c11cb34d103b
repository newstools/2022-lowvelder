The provincial EFF has already begun its groundwork of recruiting new members into its ranks as part of achieving the organisation’s membership target of one million by the end of the year. Led by the party’s Mpumalanga leader, Collen Sedibe, the provincial EFF spent the entire weekend conducting door-to-door visits in areas such as Sabie, within the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality, and Volksrust in the Gert Sibande District Municipality. “We are confident that we will recruit as many members as we can to contribute to the target of achieving a membership of one million,” said Sedibe when doing house visits in Sabie on Saturday. The electoral support for the EFF in Mpumalanga has grown over the past couple of years, a growth which has seen the party becoming the official opposition in the Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature. “We will do our part. We will work the ground as we have been doing all along,” he added. Sedibe said the EFF remains the only hope for the hopeless and pleads with the citizenry to consider this party.

It is not right that 28 years into democracy, communities are still without clean running water, streets and roads are in a bad condition and young people are without employment. This is why we say as the EFF that we are the hope for the hopeless and we want to commit ourselves to work with our masses to rebuild this country. So, come one, come all. Join the EFF and together let us remove the ANC from power,” he said.
