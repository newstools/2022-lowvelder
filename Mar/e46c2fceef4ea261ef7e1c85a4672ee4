“We are concerned that Limpopo is the only province that showed an increase in crime for the period of October 1 to December 31, 2021,” said the DA spokesperson on community safety, Katlego Phala. “According to the crime statistics for the third quarter of 2021, as released by Minister Bheki Cele on November 18, overall crime in Limpopo was on the increase, while the national average indicated a decline in crime of 2.5 percentage points. “We do take note of the decrease in sexual offences by 7.6 percentage points during the period under review, but are concerned about the sharp increases in murder, which spiked with 22.4 percentage points, and attempted murder, which showed an increase of 38.2 percentage points.” Robberies at non-residential premises and of cash-in-transit heists increased by 21.6 and 25 percentage points respectively. Phala said a major concern is the downward trend of crimes detected as a result of police action. She indicated the SAPS in Limpopo made only 3 428 arrests through police action in the quarter under review – 4 192 arrests less than in the same period last year. Phala added, “During an oversight to Dzumeri Satellite Police Station last week, we found it did not have a single vehicle at its disposal. The station must combat and prevent crime in 28 villages over vast distances without a vehicle.” According to the DA, this is not an isolated case, as the rural police stations are mostly under-resourced and under-capacitated. “Without increased resources, the Limpopo SAPS cannot expect a turnaround in the crime statistics, and our communities will remain unsafe. During the third quarter in Limpopo, seven people per day either attempted murder or murdered – the highest during the last five years. “Most murders occur in public spaces. With increased police visibility and police action, we are confident that murders will decrease. We call on Lerule-Ramakhanya to take ownership of her department to ensure that our communities are safe.”
