The City of Mbombela (CoM) has filled the potholes in town in with soil, in what it calls a temporary measure. This, according to the spokesperson for the CoM, Joseph Ngala, is because they are still waiting for material to do permanent repairs. “While waiting for it, soil will be used and, in the process, when cars drive on top of the soil, it will make it stronger, so that by the time we get the pothole patch material, it will last longer,” he said.

They reported the matter to the CoM in October 2021, but the City continues to fill the potholes with soil. When it rains, the water sweeps the filling away. In Hazyview, potholes are being filled up with soil from the De Rust intersection to town, forcing motorists to use one lane. One of the tour guides, Rufus Makwela, said it is embarrassing to use the road when transporting international tourists.

It puts the lives of our tourists in danger when we are busy changing tyres,” he said. Do you have more information about the story? Please send us an email to editorial@lowvelder.co.za.
