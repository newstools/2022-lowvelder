POLOKWANE – The top taxi drivers in the province were honoured on Saturday. The Department of Transport and Community Safety in Limpopo expedited a successful annual Driver of the Year (DOTY) competition at Bolivia Lodge. The event was attended by representatives of Limpopo taxi associations, Halfway Toyota, and the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC). The previous annual DOTY competitions had included various vehicle categories. However, the scope for the 2021/22 DOTY was limited to the taxi industry only, in adherence to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. Both female and male drivers were honoured. The department looked at the impact that the taxi industry has on the roads, the communities and the economy.
The competition started with the five districts of Limpopo, where drivers attended driver education sessions, underwent driving tests and competed, leading to the provincial competition in which winners competed for the top prize. MGM Mathode was the overall winner for both female and male categories. He took home a trophy and R10 000.
MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya said, “We should mark today, because we as a taxi industry family appreciate good work. It humbles me to see females taxi drivers.” The MEC congratulated and encouraged the winners to keep up the good work. He pleaded with the taxi industry to deal with differences in its operations before they start affecting commuters and business, which plays a significant role in the economy of the province and the country as a whole.
