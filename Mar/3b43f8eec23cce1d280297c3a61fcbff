Chronic kidney disease is known as “the silent killer”, and often goes undiagnosed until the only treatment option is chronic dialysis. Dialysis is typically a four-hour treatment required up to three times a week, which means that a focus on convenience, location and excellent care is essential in maintaining a good quality of life. Barberton Dialysis is the most recent unit of the group, opened in November 2021 and modelled on the successfully established units in White River, Welkom and Hoedspruit. “Any chronic illness places huge strain on patients and their family members. We would like to lighten the load and support them by taking a holistic approach to providing care,” said Nikki Wilson, the operations director of the group. Mariska Player, the group’s clinical director, discussed the value of fostering relationships with other healthcare providers. “Not only do we have a duty to create a tailor-made care plan for each patient based on their blood results and outcomes, but we also know that working closely with dieticians, social workers and nephrologists have a positive impact on our patients.“We wouldn’t wish kidney disease on anyone, but we feel privileged that we have been able to establish units that are cheerful, professional and where we genuinely care for our patients. After all, our motto is ‘patients first.'” • High blood pressure;• Diabetes;• A family history of impaired kidney function; Please contact your GP and ask them to assess your kidney function, or contact any of the units for guidance on what to do.
