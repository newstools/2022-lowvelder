Eskom announced that load-shedding was suspended at 20:00, March 13. “Eskom takes its mandate of supplying electricity to South Africa seriously and is fully aware of the impact load-shedding is having on the whole country,” said the statement. “Unfortunately, at times, it becomes necessary to implement load-shedding in order to protect the system and prevent a blackout. Total breakdowns have been reduced to 12 422MW while planned maintenance is 6 540MW of capacity.” It said since Friday March 11 Eskom teams have returned four generation units to service. The emergency generation reserves have also sufficiently recovered. Eight other generating units are expected to return to service by Wednesday evening, March 16. The system will remain constrained on Monday March 14 and Tuesday March 15, and it is expected that extensive use of emergency reserves will be required ahead of the units returning. The statement thanked the public for its support and patience during the load-shedding.
