Nicolette Breytenbach and her friends had a fun day out at the Lydenburg Dam wall, abseiling. Their Bible study group decided to have a team building day on Saturday February 26, and the dam was the perfect venue. Special permission has to be granted for accessing the dam wall, as it is not open to the public. With the dam levels currently at 105%, according to the Department of Water and Sanitation, it is a beautiful sight for adventure enthusiasts to behold.   This dam is the main supply as a water source for the greater Lydenburg area. The catchment area is higher up the mountain, on the Long Tom Pass. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DW) indicated a 6.3% increase in water volume this month. The dam levels of the Lydenburg Dam have risen from 96.7% to 101% since January.
The Kwena Dam on the Badfontein Road (R36), en route to Machadodorp, continues to rise and has passed the 100% mark. Farmers of the Badfontein district especially had a sigh of relief, as this is the first time in five years that the water level flows over the Kwena Dam wall. DWS calls on the public to act responsibly and use the available water wisely.
