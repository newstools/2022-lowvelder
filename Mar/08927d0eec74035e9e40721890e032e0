The Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation team conducted an intelligence-driven operation following information that a home affairs official was reportedly colluding with a Mbombela farm owner to shield 11 Malawian illegal immigrants from being deported.  The provincial Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Hawks spokesperson, Capt Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, said the arrest was made once money for the alleged deal had been exchanged. Sekgotodi said the suspects are aged between 35 and 53.  They are expected to appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Thursday March 17.
