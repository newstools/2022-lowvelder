SEKHUKHUNE – The Limpopo High Court sentenced Tshepo Boshielo (34) to life imprisonment on March 2 for three separate rape cases and the murder of a 14-year-old girl of Maserumule Park. According to the NPA spokesperson, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, police reports state that on December 25, 2015, the victim was walking alone in the streets when Boshielo raped and murdered her. “Her body was discovered by a passer-by in someone’s yard next to her homestead. The accused was only arrested in 2019, when he was linked by DNA to another two rape cases,” said Malabi-Dzhangi. She said Boshielo also committed business robberies in Mamelodi and Nebo. “During the court proceedings, Boshielo pleaded not guilty on both charges, but he was, however, still convicted. “During sentencing, Adv George Makhudu pleaded with the court not to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence, as the crimes Boshielo had committed were serious. “Judge Geriet Muller agreed with the state and also alluded to the need to fight the scourge of gender-based violence and femicide in the country, and sentenced the convicted to life imprisonment for each count.” The director of public prosecutions, Adv Ivy Thenga, commended the collaboration between Sgt Frans Chego and the state prosecutor Makhudu in bringing the perpetrator to book.
