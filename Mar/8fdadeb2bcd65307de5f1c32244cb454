Saturday March 19 saw a nationally revered artist being robbed of her personal firearm and some money. Dr Esther Mahlangu (87) was in her Siyabuswa house preparing to take a nap, when an unknown man made his way in. According to a statement by the SAPS, the incident occurred at about 15:00 on Saturday. “Details of the robbery indicate that the old woman, who was alone at the time, was preparing to take a nap when she reportedly locked all the doors of her house,” stated the report.

The man allegedly grabbed her and punched her in the face before tying both her hands up with a cable and trying to strangle her until she reportedly became unconscious.” Mahlangu said she could not recall what had happened thereafter. However, when she regained her consciousness, she realised that her house had been ransacked and that her firearm and some money had been stolen from her safe. The statement continued to say that she had sustained some bruises on her face, and that the matter was reported to the Siyabuswa police. A house robbery case was opened. “The suspect is still at large and the police urge anyone with information on his whereabouts to call the Crime Stop number on 08600 10111 or send information via the My SAPS app. All received information will be treated as confidential and callers may opt to remain anonymous.” The provincial police commissioner, Lt Gen Semakaleng Manamela, said, “It is shameful to hear that our senior citizens are now being targeted by heartless criminals who show no mercy at all. “On Sunday March 20, we had an incident of a similar nature. An old male pensioner was strangled to death in Delmas. This cannot be allowed to continue unabated. The person who committed this evil act against one of the country’s assets must be swiftly hunted down and brought to book.”
