The day was deemed a huge success and more than R6 000 was raised. The community members from Hazyview came out in their numbers, to either have their hair and beards cut or sprayed in a variety of colours by the volunteers. Throughout the day, many showed up to share a drink and a laugh with their family and friends, while their hair was being attended to.
