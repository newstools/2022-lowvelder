JANE FURSE – Makhuduthamaga Local Municipality’s mayor, Minah Bahula, has encouraged local residents to participate in sports. Bahula recently officiated the awards presentations ceremony for soccer teams that participated in the annual Makhuduthamga soccer tournament. “Sport in general ensures that young people are removed from the streets, who otherwise engage in social ills like crime and abuse of dangerous substances. Sport promotes a healthy lifestyle and socialisation for our young people. We therefore salute the sponsors and organisers of the event of this magnitude. “In sports, it is not about winning. It is about building and the creation of socialisation and friendships to the benefit of the entire community. Let us continue to encourage our youth to focus and fully understand and participate in the development of sports and other recreational activities and codes.” The tournament was won by Tebele United of Phatantswane Village. They defeated Nigeria FC 1-0 in the finals. Thirty-two teams from the Makhuduthamaga Local Municipality participated in the games.
