The Swim for Ilana day took place at the Estralita Special School on Saturday March 12. The courageous little girl with Down syndrome had a brain operation on January 24 and has since been diagnosed with Pusher syndrome and Moyamoya syndrome. “The syndrome is also called the cloud of smoke syndrome. It is very rare. This causes the blood vessels to narrow and thicken to the brain,” Elaine Thomas, her mother, said.
After the operation, Ilana was left paralysed and the fundraiser was in lieu of raising money for a special wheelchair for her. The school would like to thank the following people who made the day possible: Eunice Bam (Rietfontein Verpakkers), André du Plooy and Leana Luies (Long Tom SUPERSPAR), Lydenburg Toyota and Lydenburg la Boutique, Esmé Marx (Fun World Inflatables), Westvaal Lydenburg/ Mashishing, McGee Ford Lydenburg, Pick n Pay Lydenburg, AmaJayBee Graphics and Signs, Riette o’ Grady, Estelle van Niekerk, MP Swimming for the medals and the Glencore Proto Team.
