These vets have since been placed in state vet offices in all municipalities in the Nkangala, Gert Sibande, Ehlanzeni Districts and Bohlabela region respectively, with an aim to bring veterinary services and animal healthcare closer to rural areas across the province. They will be rendering services to pets and livestock alike, ensuring animal health.  The CCS programme started in 2016, and besides taking scarce skills closer to far-flung areas, it also aims to present on-the-job experience to the new graduates, who had just completed their studies at the University of Pretoria’s Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute. The vet school is working closely with government through the DALRRD to place the new graduates in state vet offices in all nine provinces on a twelve-month contract for practical work.  All 31 doctors have already hit the ground running, after their official welcome and induction earlier last week. Seventeen of them have been placed in vet offices in Bohlabela and Ehlanzeni District, while 14 are at vet offices in all municipalities under the Gert Sibande and Nkangala districts respectively.
