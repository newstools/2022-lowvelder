The family of Barton Shole Koma recently commemorated the life of the first municipal manager in Thaba Chweu Local Munucipality (TCLM), who had passed away on Thursday February 3. Barton was a learner at Lesodi Primary School in Mashishing and matriculated at Leolo High School in Praktiseer. Barton Shole Koma was the first municipal manager of the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM). “My brother treated everyone with respect and admiration. He was a soccer enthusiast and became a member of the ANC Youth League in 1990. He was not only a former municipal manager of TCLM, but worked in Praktiseer, Tubatse Local Municipality, and Sekhukhune District Municipality, and so many more accolades were bestowed on him in his professional life. He also was a business executive for several corporate companies. He used all the tremendous opportunities in his life to his full advantage. We realise he passed away on February 3, but a lot of former colleagues hasn’t been informed. Thank you on behalf of the extended Koma family,” said Koma.
