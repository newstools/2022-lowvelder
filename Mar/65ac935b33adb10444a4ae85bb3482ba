The men took their time, and spent almost 10 minutes in the store before taking two shoppers’ vehicles to flee the scene. According to the shopkeepers, the robbery happened at about 08:00, which made the store a clear target, as it was the only shop open at that time. The 4 Ways Liquor Store and G’s Bistro & Bar opened later in the day. “The robbers sat around the parking area in front of the store and acted as buyers, waiting for it to open. They entered calmly, but then stormed through the store and ordered us to open the cash registers,” said one of the employees. The workers and shoppers inside were forced to lie down on the ground as the suspects piled up the goods and emptied the cash registers.
