It is not too late to take a scenic drive to Dullstroom on Saturday March 19 and Sunday March 20. A market in aid of the Epilepsy Centre in Dullstroom will take place. Lovely food stalls and arts and crafts will also be on display. The stalls will open on both days at 09:00. The market will be on,  what the locals fondly refer to as, the village greens.  A day in Dullstroom is the perfect way to relax over the long weekend. The list of what to do and experience in this beautiful town is endless.
