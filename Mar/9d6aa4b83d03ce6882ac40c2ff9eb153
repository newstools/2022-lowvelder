The Mpumalanga ANC offices in Mbombela were set on fire this morning (March 17), allegedly by a man who had appeared to pay the building a visit. Even though the provincial police could not be drawn to give official comment, the information gathered on the scene suggested the suspect had carried a black backpack containing some petrol. The suspect had reportedly demanded to see President Cyril Ramaphosa and police minister Bheki Cele, and became angry when he was told they did not reside in these offices.  He allegedly stood up from his chair and started splashing petrol into some of the offices and onto some staff members, and before he could be stopped, set them alight. Fortunately, no staff member was injured or hurt. A significant part of the building’s interior, some office furniture and some files were damaged, however.

They argued that some people may not want the conference to sit as scheduled.  In the forefront, looking set to win the conference, is the grouping named Focus, which wants Mandla Ndlovu as chairperson, Speedy Mashilo as deputy chairperson, Muzi Chirwa as the secretary, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali as the deputy secretary, and Mandla Msibi as the treasurer. Other groupings in the race include such people as Lucky Ndinisa, Peter Nyoni and Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane.   Do you have more information about the story?
