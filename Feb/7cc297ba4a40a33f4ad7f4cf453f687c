The White River SPCA held its pop-up market on Saturday morning, January 29. The market was held at the kennels and opened for visitors at 09:00.  Estelle de Villiers, the branch’s chairperson, said several people had come to the pop-up market by the time it opened, however, some rainfall later that morning appeared to have scared some visitors off.  One of the SPCA’s office cats also decided to join the marketgoers by spreading himself out on some of the clothes for sale, while another cat switched between helping the SPCA staff at the payment point and curling up under the table.
