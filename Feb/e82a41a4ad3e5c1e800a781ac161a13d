The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) announced the funding list of its eligible students who intend furthering their studies in any of the 26 public universities and 50 technical and vocational education and training colleges. The spokesperson for the NSFAS, Kagisho Mamabolo, said, “NSFAS students have been waived in line with the subsidised higher education policy. This means that no NSFAS-funded student whose name appears on the funded list should be asked to pay registration.

He further said students who have not met academic eligibility criteria may lodge an appeal with NSFAS, but noted that the appeals should no longer be directed to the institution.
