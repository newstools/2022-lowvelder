Golfers from all corners of the country participated in a golfing extravaganza on Saturday. More than 30 players teed off at about 09:00 at the Tubatse Chrome Club in Steelpoort to support the Home 4 Paws
organisation. The event was organised by WealthSure on behalf of Home 4 Paws.   Marice Lubbe, the organiser, said the turnout was satisfactory. “The event was held to raise funds for Home 4 Paws, as the NPO relies on donations to save pets, mostly dogs in
Lydenburg. All proceeds went to the organisation. I am happy that we have saved many pets with this golfing competition.” She said the competition was won by Dean van Staden and Denver Fraser. “We are all winners; all the participants are winners today. We are planning to have this event annually. This can be a huge relief to the team at Home 4 Paws,” said Lubbe. Cathy Schutte, an animal rescuer and the shelter owner of Home4Paws, thanked the organisers for a job well done. “I wish to thank all who contributed to this good cause. We are so blessed and the animals are also blessed. The donations during the auction will sustain us for some days.” Home 4 Paws looks after abandoned, homeless and abused dogs. The dogs are dewormed, receive their full inoculations and are sterilised before being put up for adoption.
