BURGERSFORT – A family of Ga-Motodi lost everything when a fire destroyed their house on Monday afternoon at about 15:00. The Moraba family of Stasie found themselves homeless after their RDP house had burned down. “We are unsure of the cause of the fire, but we suspect electric faults. We are grateful that no one got injured during the fire. It was a blazing inferno and if someone had been inside, it could have been worse,” said Dianego Moraba. She said she and her six siblings and their mother had shared the three-roomed house. “The kids have lost uniforms. We are now forced to ask from neighbours. We are left with only the clothes we wore that day. We don’t even have a place to sleep. There is no food. We are pleading with the Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality’s disaster management team to assist.”
Should anyone wish to assist the Moraba family with food, clothing or anything else, contact Dianego on 071 404 2637.
Meanwhile, the Sekhukhune District Municipality’s fire department urged residents to not leave candles unattended and to avoid illegal electricity connections, as these are two of the main causes of house fires.
