The Kwena Dam upstream of the City of Mbombela is still spilling over despite a drop in water levels. According to the Department of Water and Sanitation’s (DWS) weekly state of reservoirs report of February 14, the Kwena Dam recorded a slight decline from last week’s 100.8% to 100.4%. The decline in the Kwena Dam is in line with the provincial average water levels in the listed dams and the water management areas (WMA).

Inasmuch as most listed dams in the Lowveld recorded declines in water volumes, the majority, like Kwena Dam, are still above 100%. Blyderivierpoort Dam dropped from 100.7% to 100.5%, Buffelskloof from 100.3% to 100.2%, Driekoppies from 101% to 100.7%, Longmere from 101.1% to 100.9%, Witklip from 100.6% to 100.5%, and Primkop from 100.9% to 100.4%. Klipkopjes and Vygeboom dams went below 100%, dropping to 99.8% and 102.8% to 99.8% respectively.

Da Gama Dam remained unchanged at 99.8%. The DWS called on the public to continue conserving water as the levels in the listed dams and catchment areas in the Lowveld decline, even though there is still enough water in storage. It further encouraged the public to play an active role in water supply security by using the available water wisely and sparingly, as South Africa is a water-scarce country.
