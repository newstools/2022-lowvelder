This February, Burgersfort Wood Centre turns 20. The store has been offering quality products at affordable prices while giving customers the best service in the hardware industry. “We specialise in various types of highquality gloss board, melamine boards, other types of board and timber. We cut and edge in-store. We also have a wide range of building materials, ceilings, plumbing, tiles, lighting, sanitary ware and paint,” said store manager Muhammad Arbee. He indicated that the store recently added three new departments for customers’ convenience. “We love to make life easier for you, so we started with our state-of-the art solar power department, the cheapest in town. “We have an aluminium factory where you can design your own windows or doors to suit your taste. We opened our third department with a bang, the latest in car audio and sound. We also stock borehole pumps and tyres.” Arbee confidently added, “A visit to our store will guarantee your time and money are well spent! Everything under one roof.” Burgersfort Wood Centre has made major improvements to the store, which is conveniently situated on the R37 beyond the Tubatse Bridge, ensuring easy access to the store from both ends of town. The store is easily spotted from the main road. Wood Centre trades from Mondays to Thursdays, 08:00 to 17:00, Fridays from 08:00 to 12:30 and 14:00 to 17:00, and Saturdays from 08:00 to 14:00. “Our friendly staff are waiting to welcome you to a new dimension of decor and living. Celebrate two decades of excellent service by visiting our store for many many specials and discounts.
“At Burgersfort Wood Centre, we don’t get disrupted by load-shedding; our store is fully run on solar power. Visit our store to share the fun as we celebrate our 20 year anniversary,” concluded Arbee.
