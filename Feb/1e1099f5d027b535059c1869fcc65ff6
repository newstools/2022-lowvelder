Over 50 members of the law enforcement and education departments led a random search at two schools in Mashishing/ Lydenburg on Tuesday February 8. The remnants of dagga and the street drug, nyaope, were discovered in one of the schools.  The Mpumalanga Department of Education was joined by the Lydenburg SAPS, colleagues from the Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison (DCSSL), the Lydenburg K9 Unit, SAPS from the Enhlanzeni district office, Hazyview Public Order Policing, SAPS members from the Acornhoek cluster, the provincial traffic department and local emergency services. “The operation was successful more so on the visibility of different disciplines working together and the fear of unruly children, who were not expecting the operation at their school. Management of the two schools appreciated and welcomed the initiative and requested follow up operations at their schools as their learners are getting out of hand,” said Capt Kaizer Moela, Lydenburg SAPS spokesperson. This operation is part of the department’s School Safety Programme and is also aimed at promoting safety and eradicating bullying in schools.  Officials at one of the schools. Photo supplied: DCSSL.  According to Musi Moeti, DCSSL spokesperson, the MEC Vusi Shongwe, has identified problem schools in the province. “The department and other role players will continue with random school visits in Thaba Chweu Local Municipality and the Gert Sibande, Nkangala and Ehlanzeni districts. The MEC urges learners not to bully one another, but rather to protect one another. He was shocked by a bullying incident in eMalahleni last week. As a department, we want to work with the schools to support them so that crime can be eradicated in schools. We are also in support of the Adopt-A-Cop programme that is already in place at schools. We condemn drug use in schools and hope these random visits will help to keep the criminal element at bay,” said Moeti.
