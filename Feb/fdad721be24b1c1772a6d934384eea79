LYDENBURG – Once again the local communities have shown their good hearts by donating to the needy. Members from the Mashishing and Steelpoort communities recently opened their hearts to Gr R children from the Thaba Chweu Boarding School, situated on the outskirts of Mashishing. These five- and six-year-olds are in the school’s boarding facility. Eighty teddy bears were donated to keep these little ones company at night, and to cuddle with them. Moses Mogakane, the principal of the school, said it was heart-warming to see that people cared about the well-being of the small children who miss their homes. The deputy principal of the boarding school, Jacob Nawa, thanked Hester van Zyl from the Step Foundation, Hestia Brink, Juanita Hatting of Goudster Playschool, Lezanne Brink from Turning Tides, Ansie Smulders from Lapeng Guest Lodge, Marietjie Smuts from Terma Electric and Theresa Boshoff from Bebels and every individual who helped to makes these children’s lives easier. It is not the first time that the kids have received the teddies from the Good Samaritans. Last year before winter, the same kind of gifts were handed over to the school.
