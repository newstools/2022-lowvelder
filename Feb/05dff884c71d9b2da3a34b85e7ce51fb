This special evening will be held at the Mbombela Stadium on February 11, so get your cocktail attire ready and prepare your taste buds for something unknown. At R500 per couple, you get a welcome drink and a silver platter or picnic basket (including a paired drink). Your platter or basket will be a surprise, as you will draw a ticket to see what you get. No need to fret, though; all the food will be supplied by top-rated restaurants in the Lowveld, so your surprise is bound to be a treat.
