The man implicated in the 2020 murder of Lt Col Leroy Bruwer will appear again in the Mpumalanga High Court for the start of his trial on June 6. Sinovuyo Salela (30) had appeared in the Mpumalanga High Court both on February 7 and 9, however the National Prosecuting Authorities provincial spokesperson, Monica Nyuswa, said the court has moved Salela’s case to June 6. It is expected to end on June 17. Nyuswa said the reason for this is to secure an isiXhosa interpreter.

Salela handed himself over to the police in Tsolo in the Eastern Cape and was then transported to Mbombela where he has been held ever since.
