The popular Afrikaans singer, Irene-Louise van Wyk, had all her audience’s takkies burning during her performance at Mustangs – The Dancing Place on Saturday evening, January 29. The evening also marked the venue’s first-ever family show, allowing families to bring along their children. Van Wyk started her set at 19:00, garnering a large crowd of excited children right in front of the stage, singing and calling out to her as she sang. The crowd almost immediately started calling for the singer to start with her famous “Tekkies brand”, but Van Wyk decided to warm up the crowd with an enthusiastic medley of songs by Meghan Trainor, such as “All About That Bass”, “Me too”, and “Dear Future Husband”.
