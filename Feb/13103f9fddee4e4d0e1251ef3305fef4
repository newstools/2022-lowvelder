According to an Eskom statement, stage 2 load-shedding was due to a shortage of generation capacity following breakdowns at two generating units. The load-shedding will be implemented from 11:00 today (February 2) until 05:00 on Monday. “Since the weekend Eskom has utilised significant amounts of emergency generating reserves, which have now been depleted and need to be replenished. Eskom will need this period of load-shedding to replenish the emergency generation reserves. “A unit each at Kusile and Kendal power stations tripped. Delays in returning units at Kusile, Tutuka, Duvha, Lethabo and Grootvlei have also contributed to the current supply constraints,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. The power utility said it expects at least three generating units back in service by Wednesday afternoon.
