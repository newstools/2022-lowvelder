Following months of financial struggle, the Barberton SPCA has finally been brought to its knees. The organisation’s secretary, Marlies Liebenberg, said she received the go-ahead from the NSPCA yesterday, which prompted the announcement – an SPCA’s closure must be approved by the NSPCA.

This is beyond our financial means. “As there has been no response to our land application at the City of Mbombela, nor any payment of outstanding pound fees for 2019 and 2020 as negotiated, Nico Wessels of Anzel Trading kindly offered us land on the corner of the present property,” said Liebenberg. The cost of relocating, though, is totally prohibitive. “As it is, we already run at a monthly loss.” ALSO READ: SPCAs are in dire straits, municipality’s silence is deafening As of February 23, the Barberton SPCA will not be able to render any more services to the Umjindi area as the breakdown of the current structure will commence. “The execution of the dog by-laws thus revert back to the municipality, and cruelty cases can be reported to the Nelspruit SPCA on 013 753 3582.“We will, however, continue with the charity shop, but not under the auspices of the SPCA. “We thank all our local loyal supporters for their pet food donations, financial contributions and other support; without you, this animal charity would not have survived for 36 years. “Be kind to animals, they rely on you.”
