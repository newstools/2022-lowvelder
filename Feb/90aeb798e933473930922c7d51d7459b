LEBOWAKGOMO – Premier Stanley Mathabatha is among the first in Limpopo to be counted for the Census 2022. Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) visited Mathabatha at his house in Tooseng Village, Ga-Mphahlele, on February 3 for him to actively participate in the nationwide census drive to count the population of South Africa. After completing the required census questionnaire, Mathabatha indicated that the process was smooth, as it had not taken long for him and the fieldworker to go through it. “This exercise is very important and necessary for all citizens to partake in. It is seamless, and it helps government to plan properly to improve the livelihoods of communities. The data collected here will indicate the level of living conditions of communities. This exercise helps lawmakers and leaders from all spheres of government to come up with plan of action, or to see what type of spatial development is needed for a specific area as opposed to a blanket approach to development,” said Mathabatha. Stats SA’s Limpopo executive manager, Nthambeleni Mukwevho, led the team of fieldworkers to the premier’s household. Mukwevho said each and every person within the borders of the republic has to be counted, from the president to the homeless and those on the move. “Today we are here for your household. We shall handle this information in line with Statistics Act 6 of 1999, which provides that the information we gather is confidential,” Mukwevho explained to the premier. One of the matters Mukwevho highlighted was that they were using the month-long activity to give local people an opportunity to get temporary jobs such as fieldworkers and enumerators. The fieldworker who assisted Mathabatha to answer the questionnaire, Kabelo Mphahlele, is a resident of Tooseng. Mathabatha commended Stats SA for employing local people as fieldworkers.
