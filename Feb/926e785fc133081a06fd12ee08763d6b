BURGERSFORT – The community of Mabotsha is eager to see development. In ensuring the village improves, they have formed a non-profit organisation (NPO) called Mabotsha Development Caregivers. The NPO consists mainly of youths from the community led by a determined Enock Mphogo. “We aim to assist the needy and vulnerable community members. We wish to get rid of poverty in this area. Our organisation consists of the youth, the disabled and also a few elderly members who are guiding us. We wish more disabled people will join us. Gone are the days they spent indoors feeling uncomfortable to face the world. We also wish to advise our community to stop hiding them away in homes.” Mphogo said the NPO believes that every South African child should grow up in a healthy, safe and nurturing environment. Mphogo said the NPO was first registered in November 2020. “Since we were registered, we have successfully donated a wheelchair to a disabled member of our community. We arranged school uniforms to a needy family in our village. We are also into sport development, as we arranged soccer balls for the local ladies’ soccer club. “On April 27, we will be holding the official launch at Bump Jive Sportsgrounds. That day, we will also have a disability awareness campaign.”
