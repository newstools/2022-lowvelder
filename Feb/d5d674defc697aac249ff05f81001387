BURGERSFORT – The Old Penge Road’s (D2537) condition has improved. The Limpopo government and the Road Agency Limpopo (Ral) have kept their promise to revamp the road. For the past years motorists have flooded the R37 as an alternative because the pothole-riddled road damaged their vehicle’s tyres. The upgrades are now nearing completion. “We are grateful that the government has heard our pleas, the road is drivable and this will help to minimise traffic congestion,” said motorist Edgar Maisela who uses it to get to Burgersfort every day. Previously, the residents have expressed their concern about the deplorable condition of the D2537 that also links with the R555 to Ohrigstad and Burgersfort. Steelburger/Lydenburg News contacted Ral’s Matome Sekuba who indicated that they have embarked on a campaign to fix all the roads in Limpopo. “We initiated a war against potholes, and we hope to have better roads in the province.” In 2020 the former MEC for the Department of Roads, Public Works and Infrastructure, Dickson Masemola,
and Ral visited Tubatse while embarking on roadshows to address road infrastructure challenges. Masemola said, “This is part of the continuing work to visit, inspect and experience first-hand what road
users go through on a daily basis, as part of the preparation for resolving the infrastructure challenges in the
province. “We are going to ensure major rehabilitation of the roads in Tubatse. Our mandate is infrastructure provision and
maintenance.” It is understood that there are also ongoing upgrades for 14 kilometres out of Burgersfort to Lydenburg. Meanwhile, contractors are on-site to erect the Motaganeng access bridge at GaManoke. The bridge is still in its early stages and is expected to be completed before the end of the year.
