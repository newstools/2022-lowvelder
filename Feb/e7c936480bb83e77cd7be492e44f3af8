The Lydenburg radio station, Mash FM 91.7 Stereo, celebrated this day on the air. The first wireless in the 1890s. For decades, radio has been trusted by people from all walks of life to keep them informed and entertained. It connects the young and old and people from all over the world.  Another reason for the station celebrating World Radio Day is that it recently received a grant from the Media Development and Diversity Agency of R2.4m. “We were able to purchase an alternative power supply, computers and two laptops. New broadcasting equipment was also acquired,” said George Maphanga, the manager. The station received its permanent broadcasting licence in January 2010. It has grown with leaps and bounds and is now broadcasting at a radius of 30 kilometres. Big celebrations are planned for later this year to commemorate the station’s 12 years of broadcasting. Mash FM broadcasts in siSwati, Sepedi and English. “One of the most popular shows is the breakfast show hosted by Andile Mhlanga. Another popular show is the Sesi Khona Drive Show with Pat Masinga, better known as DJ PSK Shobane,” said Maphanga. The Mpumalanga Community Radio Forum, of which Maphanga is the secretary, is planning a radio day for later this year to celebrate broadcasting across the province and the people behind the scenes.
