The purpose of the day was to give donations to the children and to inspire them with what their futures could be. The school went all out for its learners as SANDF, Old Mutual, SPAR and members of Mpumalanga’s Department of Education spent their day at the school motivating them to have hope for their future. Capt SK Maseko and other crucial members of the SANDF explained their different roles in the defense force to the learners and donated shoes to some of the children. Many enjoyed Capt Maseko’s humour and wisdom as he played his part as the day’s MC. ALSO READ: Do Valentine’s Day your way!

Miss Teen Universe finalist Nosipho Mbolekwa of Lowveld High in Mbombela was also invited to be an example of hard work, and inspired some learners to chase their dreams and stand strong for what they believed in.
