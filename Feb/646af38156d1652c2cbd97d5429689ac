Bossies Community Justice was blessed by the community with some much-needed funds last week. Along with Jock Pub & Grill’s Weekly Wednesday Joker Draw, Craig Strydom of Jock invited Albert Gryvenstein from Bossies onto the stage. Here he handed Gryvenstein a donation of R10 000.

He has taken about a 50% pay cut. There are some operational costs that simply cannot be cut, though, he said. “I’m incredibly grateful to both Jock and Neil Diamond who donated another R10 000 to our cause. “The work does not stop, and these donations will definitely make a difference. We are dependent on the community and without their support, what we do will not be possible.” ALSO READ: ‘Certain issues’ cause delays Should you wish to contribute to Bossies’ fight against crime, contact Gryvenstein on 082 567 5212 or email him on albert@bossiesj.co.za.
