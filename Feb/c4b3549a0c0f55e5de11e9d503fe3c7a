Everyone is welcome to join Mpumalanga Heritage on Saturday February 12 at 09:00 outside Silver Mist in Kantoor Street in Kaapsehoop, from where the search will start. A selection of copies of old photographs will be available. Each group, couple or individual will disperse into town to find the right spots and take some shots by camera or cellphone. ALSO READ: Police search for men who stole 13 chainsaws in Sabie At noon, everyone will meet again at the Nagkantoor across the road to delve into this interesting archive of South African press and media history while enjoying a cold one at the bar. Lunch will be a bring and braai with fires, pap and sheba being provided. Drinks will be in support of Nagkantoor. All the successful pictures of the day can afterwards be mailed to marius@lowveldmedia.co.za or posted on the Mpumalanga Heritage Facebook group at www.facebook.com/groups/457364320955304.
