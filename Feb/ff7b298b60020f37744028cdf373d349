The estate is recognised as one of South Africa’s top wildlife residential estates, and with so much to love, one can understand why families of all ages are escaping the hustle and bustle of big cities to enjoy the tranquility of nature at Likweti Estate. Residents can play hard and work hard with effective internet connectivity enhancing the convenience of working from home. Residents at Likweti Bushveld Farm Estate have access to unspoilt land with a host of family-friendly outdoor activities, like mountain biking, trail running, walking or hiking, bird watching, or picnicking beside a dam. With a vast variety of bird species and plains game like giraffe, kudu, nyala, blue wildebeest and zebra roaming freely, residents can enjoy the grandeur of nature from the comfort of their dream home.  Likweti Views, the development’s third phase, was recently launched and is proving to be as popular as the first two sold out phases: Likweti Hills and Likweti Plains. All major infrastructure and services have been completed for Views. There has never been a better time to own the outdoors and invest in a quality lifestyle than now! Whether you want to design and build on your own, with your preferred architect and builder, or decide to use one of the building packages currently available, a spacious one-hectare stand with breathtaking views of the Lowveld will be the perfect foundation.  One-hectare stands at Likweti Views (phase 3) are now selling from R1.1m. Get in touch with one of our estate agents for an appointment to view both the estate and the stands on offer.
