With one day to spare, the very last dog at Barberton SPCA was adopted before its official closure on Wednesday February 23.  Its secretary, Marlies Liebenberg, said they were about halfway done with breaking down the current facility, and were grateful that it no longer has any animals. On February 19, the SPCA’s management thought it was down to its last dog that needed a home, but between then and February 23, four more surrenders (three dogs and one cat) and one stray showed up at its soon-to-be-broken-down doorstep.  All the dogs except the stray and the cat had found homes by February 22. These two were relocated to Nelspruit SPCA.
