Tom Cruise took a moment to have a chat with some fans in Hoedspruit yesterday. After landing his helicopter in the usual spot with his group of fans waiting, instead of waving and getting into his car, he walked over to the group, answered a few questions and thanked them for all of their support. One member of the small crowd, Savanna Kay (13), drew a heart in the sand with “Tom” written in it prior to Cruise’s arrival. When he walked over, they drew his attention to the heart and got a heartfelt thank you.
