Tebatso Maripane has released a book titled The Valley of Success. The book is a collection of poems dealing with loss, pain, depression and abandonment. It consists of 30 poems. The themes include abuse, the normal order of life, death, crime, love, disease, trust, betrayal, hope and many other relevant topics not often addressed by a teenage girl. The book was published and printed by Baropodi Consulting and Services. “I believe that life consists of challenges that are not meant to destroy us, but about changing the wrong mindset in our society. In this book, I encourage the youth to focus on education,” said the grade 12 pupil of Leolo Technical High School.  Tebatso said this publication is the first of many. She believes this is just one step away from her future, as she hopes to write several other books. “I am planning to write more about brightening the future of the youth in our society. I am not happy with my peers who are into drugs and alcohol abuse. Somehow I wish to transform them into better people,” she said. Tebatso would like to study law after matric.
