Pupils at Thaba Chweu Boarding School will lose a few days of schooling this term. Steelburger/Lydenburg News has learned that lessons have been stopped and pupils have left the school premises. “The school is currently closed due to lack of sanitation and water. The learners were sent home on Monday. The water crisis is a big challenge for the day-today running of the school,” said one of the teachers, who chose to remain anonymous. Steelburger/Lydenburg News spoke to several concerned parents. “This is not good for our kids. It is just the beginning of the school year and they are experiencing disturbances. The department should intervene,” one said. Another parent remarked, “The school has always had water problems, even when it opened they had issues. They always bought water from nearby farmers.” In 2020, the DA said in a media statement, “The department did not ensure that the water licence application process was undertaken. It will therefore not be possible for the school to operate without sanitation services and will remain unutilised until the sanitation service is functional,” the party warned. On Thursday, the Mpumalanga Department of Education spokesperson Jasper Zwane said they have sent their team to do some inspections at the school. “The department has sent a team to make an assessment and to engage all role players. The team will thereafter advise on a course of action to be undertaken going forward.” Thaba Chweu Boarding School was opened in 2020 after the Mpumalanga department closed down eight non-viable schools. The school accommodates kids from all over Thaba Chweu Local Municipality and Sekhukhune District Municipality.
