Pediatric Care Africa’s 7 000-kilometre journey around the country to raise funds for children in urgent need of medical care, began early on February 13 at White River Square. Dr André Hattingh, founder of Pediatric Care Africa (PCA), hopped onto his motorcycle at 09:00 on Sunday and left the Square to start the first leg of his long journey, which saw him overnighting in Louis Trichardt in Limpopo on the evening of February 13. Scores of bikers from Limpopo and Mbombela came out to support Hattingh and his cause. Pr TJ Maré of We Care 4 Nelspruit and Lazyja Steyn of Skankane Transport were also present to show their support. Steyn even sponsored a bakkie, branded with the Skankane logo, that will be driven along with Hattingh and fellow riders during the trip. Leo Crompvoets, the head of a Netherlands-based organisation, Stichting Support Pediatric Care Africa, was present at the start of the event. The organisation is responsible for raising much-needed funds for PCA from the Netherlands. Freedom Motorcycles Mbombela sponsored tyres for Hattingh’s bike during the trip, should he need a spare or two.
