BURGERSFORT – Tragedy struck the Ntimane family. A shooting incident was reported at the popular Fish House Lifestyle Pub. The Driekop SAPS outside town has opened a case of murder after a man had allegedly shot and killed his wife on Tuesday February 15 at about 06:00. “It is alleged that community members heard gunshots at Fish House Pub, situated in Legonong Section in the Driekop policing area. On arrival they found the body of the owner and his wife with gunshot wounds,” said the Limpopo SAPS spokesperson, Brig Motlafelo Mojapelo. “The SAPS was called and immediately commenced with a preliminary investigation, which revealed that the man might have shot his wife and thereafter himself.” The deceased were identified as Thulani Ntimane (47) and Masodi Ntimane (36).
According to the SAPS, the motive for the incident is unknown at this stage, but domestic violence cannot be ruled out. Police investigations still continue. Meanwhile, the Limpopo MEC for social development, Nkakareng Rakgoale, has condemned the incident. Rakgoale reiterated her call for people who are facing difficulties in their relationships and families to approach social workers for professional help, rather than resorting to violence. “Social workers will activate our family preservation programme as well as ensure that they assist in resolving the stalemate. It can’t be that when people have an issue, you find one of them resorting to violence. Our constitution guarantees every one of us the right to life, and this right must not be violated. People must find peaceful ways of resolving differences.” She said a team of social workers has been dispatched to the area to conduct assessments and immediately start with the provision of psychosocial support to the affected parties.
