The skywalk will offer visitors a panoramic view of the Lowveld with a drop of more than 900 metres down into the indigenous forest-clad ravine. It will consist of a cantilevered glass walkway suspended off the edge of the cliff, protruding about 12 metres outward. This walkway is expected to be located even higher than the Grand Canyon Skywalk, which stands at between 150 metres and 280 metres, and the Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge in China, which is 260 metres at its highest point. According to a statement by the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency PA, the skywalk will also host other activities, such as a sky swing and a zero-gravity room.

It is estimated that the construction of the skywalk will create 300 jobs, while it will offer more than 100 jobs once completed. Jerry Mabena, CEO of Motsamayi Tourism Group, said the Blyde River region attracts nearly a million visitors yearly.
