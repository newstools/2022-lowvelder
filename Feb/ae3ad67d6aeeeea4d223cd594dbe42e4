These tribes, the Masoyi, the Inkambeni, the Jongilanga, the Mathibela, the Hoxani, the Kgarudi and the Mduli, each had a representative at the meeting held at the mall on January 10, at which they gratefully accepted the help of Twin City. The mall initiated a school project in which the learners’ schoolbooks would be covered by its team, and asked each tribe to represent two schools that needed support. Not only did Twin City reach out to the schools, but a wrapping station was also set up for any parent to bring their children’s books to be covered. According to the marketing manager of Lowveld Mall, Tania Manjate, more than 10 000 books were covered with wrapping paper in less than 20 days. The mall also supplied food parcels that would last the schools some time. “We always do more for the community, because we know that help can go a long way for a child in need,” said Manjate.
