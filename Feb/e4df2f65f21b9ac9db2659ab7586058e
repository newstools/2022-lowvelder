Laerskool Numbi implemented a new disciplinary programme to motivate learners to strive for more than just academic achievements. André Enslin of Leadway Projects visited the school on January 17 to address matters regarding the new programme. During the past few years of Covid-19, school life was not easy for teachers and learners, especially with all the new day-to-day challenges schools had to adapt to. As schools like Laerskool Numbi regained the opportunity to allow all its learners to attend school, the children had to adapt once again. Enslin introduced the programme at the school to drive the learners to push for healthy living and to develop leadership qualities. The school was given keychains that consisted of three colours, green for “go”, orange for “slow” and red for “woah”.

The way forward will be overseen by Bobby, the programme referee and mascot, controlling the team board values. The programme rewards positive leadership members with a star-for-you system. “The project consists of a newly developed identification recovery tool that will be able to assist every person in this programme to rediscover their personal leadership values. The programme will bring back the leadership values in every person, becoming part of a new internal system,” said Enslin. Do you have more information about the story?
