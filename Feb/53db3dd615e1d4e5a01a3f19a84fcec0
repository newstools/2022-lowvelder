Levy Nangoma (29) was arrested on December 3 for the murder of Boithakgatso Komane (6). Boithakgatso of Praktiseer Dark City was found dead in a neighbour’s yard on December 3. The incident happened during the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children Campaign. The suspect was arrested and on his first day in court, December 6, he chose to abandon his bail application. Nangoma once again ignored his bail application as he appeared in a packed court on Tuesday. His case has been postponed to March 30. The Limpopo SAPS stated, “It is alleged that the victim was playing with other children in the neighbourhood, when her mother noticed that she had disappeared and started to search for her, with assistance of the community. The SAPS was called and proceeded with the search operation. The child’s body was discovered dumped in a neighbour’s yard. “The police immediately commenced a manhunt for the suspect, who was said to be residing in the same street as the victim. He was found hiding in a neighbour’s yard and was immediately arrested. Preliminary investigations conducted at the scene indicated that the victim was raped before she was killed,” said the Limpopo SAPS spokesperson, Brig Motlafelo Mojapelo, after the arrest. The provincial police commissioner, Lt Gen Thembi Hadebe, commended the police for their prompt response that led to the arrest within hours of the crime being committed. Among those who supported the Komane family by attending the court proceedings, was Eddie Maila, the mayor of Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality.
