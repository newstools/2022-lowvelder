Some students of the University of Mpumalanga (UMP) have blockaded the road entrances with bricks due to a conflict between taxi operators and parents regarding student travel to and from the university. According to a statement by the UniMpumalanga Central SRC, it has come to its attention that some owners of the off-campus accredited residences are not honouring their accreditation by not providing all services that are stipulated in the accreditation agreement between the service providers and the university. “The agreement expects all landlords to adhere to the accreditation criteria by ensuring that students who are accommodated at their facilities must be provided with transportation from/and to the campus. The SRC is requesting all students who are not being transported to the university to forward their accommodation details to the leadership so that we attend to such cases,” it said. “We are, however, also concerned about the safety of our students and it is the responsibility of the service provider to ensure that all students arrive on campus. We are in full support of the continuation of the academic year with contact classes so that social cohesion and vibrancy of attending classes continue,” said the statement.
