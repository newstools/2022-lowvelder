Penryn College held its traditional Grade Eight tie ceremony on Friday February 11. During it, the new grade eights became fully fledged Penryn pupils. According to a Penryn teacher, Jozelle Grobbelaar, the tie is symbolic of this moment. “They will wear it for the rest of their school career and wear it with pride, because it is symbolic of the success of Penryn, and the generations of learners who have passed before,” she said.
