JANE FURSE – The newly appointed chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), Rogers Monama, wants to see improvements in Limpopo. Monama was appointed to the new position on January 28. He indicated that its high time people in the province get deserving, quality services that are budgeted for. He said his objective was to improve the financial status and performance of provincial institutions so they can achieve unqualified audit opinions. Monama, who is not stranger to public service leadership, previously served in other legislative oversight committees and at senior government level. He revealed that Scopa will play an oversight role in all the provincial institutions and put emphasis on
compliance with supply chain management processes. Meanwhile Makhuduthamaga Local Municipality’s mayor, Minah Bahula, has sent a congratulatory
message of support to Monama. The mayor believes Monama will steer the ship to ensure fundamental prescripts of public finance management are followed and respected by government departments as well as their
constitutional public entities. “Monama is a strategist. He served the people of Makhuduthamaga as a councillor and also at district
level of the Sekhukhune District Municipality in the early 2000s. “He brings with him, quality and visionary leadership to the committee that is mandated to play a watchdog role on public finances, and also commit to its oversight and strategic vision in building government that is responsive to the basic needs of its people driven by the idea of a better and quality life for all.”
