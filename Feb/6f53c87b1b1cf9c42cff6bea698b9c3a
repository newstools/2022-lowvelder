The man travelling in a Volkswagen Polo was driving with two other passengers in his private vehicle. The taxi drivers travelling in a white VW Caddy wanted the passengers to use taxis from the Lydenburg/ Burgersfort taxi rank. According to sources, an argument ensued when the Polo driver was asked to travel without the passengers. He argued that they were travelling together and were heading to the same destination, and were business partners. “After an argument the gentleman in the Polo fired shots at the taxi association members to defend himself and escaped,” said one of the eye witnesses. Steelburger/Lydenburg News understands that there were no injuries sustained during the shooting. According to motorists in Burgersfort and Lydenburg, they are always stopped when they travel on the R37. “They tried to stop me and my family twice already because of driving a Kombi, so even buying a bigger car for family is also not allowed in their eyes anymore, so what does the word freedom mean? questioned a motorist who chose to remain anonymous.
