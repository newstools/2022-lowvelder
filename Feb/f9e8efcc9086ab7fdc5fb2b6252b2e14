The upgrade to Dr Enos Mabuza Drive is progressing with the completion date still expected for later this year. White Hazy Building Construction has been at the site working on the upgrades for the past few weeks, and is in the process of creating another lane to try and free up traffic during peak hours. Japie Visser of White Hazy said another lane was being created as they were awaiting electrical contractors to remove sensitive cables from beneath a section of Dr Enos Mabuza Drive. “While we wait for the cables to be removed, we will continue to work around that section of the road and continue with the upgrades,” he said.

The City of Mbombela’s spokesperson, Joseph Ngala, said that certain issues had caused a few delays and the 18-month contract with White Hazy has been extended by 136 days. He added that cost of the upgrade was R79.8m and that there had been no overexpenditure on the project. It is still under budget, therefore no extra funds need to be allocated for the upgrade.
