Mdluli was among six other local tavern owners who participated in the Rooikat BB Hyundai competition. The official draw took place last Friday at The Capital Mbombela Hotel. Mdluli said he was born with a lucky charm, as this was not his first win in such competitions. “Even though I have won in many other competitions, I am over the moon that I have just won this bakkie. I would like to thank Charl Breytenbach (the owner of Rooikat Liquor) for assisting me in terms of stocking Heineken. This bakkie will make my job very easy, because I will be able to transport stock of alcohol to my customers,” said the jubilant Mdluli. ALSO READ: Hit-and-run court case postponed February. Breytenbach said, “I have been in the liquor business for 20 years and we have experienced a very tough two years in the industry, because of Covid-19 and the lockdowns. We then decided to partner with Heineken SA, as we wanted to create some excitement among our customers who have been suffering due to the Covid-19 restrictions and were not able to trade.” Do you have more information about the story?
