There are many families that depend on social grants for survival and those are often not enough to sustain these families,” said Mofokeng.  She said many learners, especially from disadvantaged families, drop out of schools because they lack the proper school uniforms and do not have sanitary pads. “Through Nikela I can lend a helping hand and aid those families,” she continued. This beauty queen said she wanted to continue giving these kids a better life.  “In future my organisation will create jobs for the unemployed and educate young boys and girls about GBV, drugs and different career paths,” she added.
