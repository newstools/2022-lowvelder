Learners were yet again caught off guard when the police and education officials arrived at their schools without warning. On Thursday February 11 it was operation clampdown for two secondary schools in Mashishing and Skhila. This is part of the DCSSL’s school safety programme that has been reaching great heights since its implementation in 2021. On Tuesday February 8, schools in Mashishing and Kellysville were searched. Nyaope and dagga were found at one of them. The DCSSL was joined by the Lydenburg SAPS, some staff members of the Department of Education, the Lydenburg K9 Unit, SAPS members from the Ehlanzeni District Office, the Hazyview public order policing unit, SAPS members from the former Acornhoek Cluster, the provincial traffic department and local emergency services. This operation aims to promote safety and eradicate bullying in schools. According to Moeti Mmusi, the DCSSL’s spokesperson, MEC Vusi Shongwe had identified problem schools in the province. “The department and other role players will continue with random visits in Thaba Chweu Local Municipality, the Gert Sibande, Nkangala and Ehlanzeni districts. The MEC urged learners not to bully but to protect one another. He was shocked by a bullying incident in eMalahleni last week. As a department, we want to work with the schools to support them to eradicate crime there. We are also in support of the adopt-a-cop programme that is already in place. We condemn drug abuse and hope these random visits will help to keep the criminal elements at bay,” said Mmusi. “The operation was successful, more so on the visibility of various disciplines working together and the fear of unruly learners who were not expecting the operation at their school. The management of the two schools appreciated and welcomed the initiative and requested follow-up operations as their learners were getting out of hand,” said Capt Kaizer Moela, the Lydenburg SAPS spokesperson.
