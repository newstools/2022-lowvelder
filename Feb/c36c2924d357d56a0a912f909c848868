Pet owners in the area heeded the invitation and took advantage of the free service to get their dogs and cats vaccinated. The vaccination campaign, themed “Rabies End Here”, also presented an opportunity for those pets that have other health issues and wounds, to be attended to. Rabies is deadly and can be fatal to humans as well. It is found in many species of wildlife, and can be passed from any infected animal to another, most through biting, though scratches pose a small possibility of transmission. Rabies gets transmitted to humans almost entirely through bites from infected dogs and cats. The disease is incurable, but the good news though is that rabies is preventable, and the best way to protect yourself and your pets is by vaccinating your dogs and cats.  Pet owners in Lothair also had an opportunity to engage the veterinary officials on rabies, asking questions about some myths and facts associated with the disease. They were also encouraged to seek medical attention immediately if they get bitten by a dog. Symptoms on an affected animal include fever, staggering, difficulty in swallowing, excessive drooling and paralysis. The rabies vaccination season is held annually during the month of September, during which World Rabies Vaccination Day falls on the 28th. The day is aimed at raising awareness about the impact of rabies on both humans and animals, and how to eliminate the zoonotic disease. During September, the veterinary services officials from the department go all out to vaccinate dogs and cats against rabies. Pet owners are encouraged to visit a state vet office closer to them, to have their pets vaccinated. For more information, visit our website.
