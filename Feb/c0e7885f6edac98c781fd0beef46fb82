Mpumalanga’s AB Steyn and Limpopo’s Dawie Groenewald appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on February 23 and 24. The pair’s previous appearance was on December 10 last year when the case was postponed for the fourth time. Some issues were raised by each of their legal representatives yesterday including that the state was dragging its feet in the case, that the state should be held responsible for the teams’ travel costs because of the delays, and that documents were not presented in the way they were supposed to be. Court adjourned at the end of the day and the matter continued today. The magistrate said after reviewing the facts before her, that the delays thus far were not unreasonable and the state would not be held responsible for the costs incurred by the two legal teams.
