BURGERSFORT – In celebration of Toyota’s 60th anniversary, Burgersfort Toyota took to the streets to take a stand
against litter. The staff embarked on a cleaning campaign on February 9. They were joined by 60 volunteers from the local communities to clean the streets in the CBD for 60 minutes. Dressed in white T-shirts, with gloves and refuse bags, they started by collecting rubbish next to the dealership’s premises. Another group cleaned the long-distance taxi rank, which was full of garbage and rotten food. Afterwards they collected litter on the R37.  “Our message is simple. Play your part. Keep our town clean.
“We invite locals to join hands in doing something beneficial for our community. We cannot fold our arms and expect the government to do everything,” said Bilaal Tayob of the dealership. As part of the celebrations, Burgersfort Toyota said it has lined up numerous projects to better the local communities. “We recently donated stationery to pupils at Laerskool Burgersfort. This is to encourage them to focus on their education and to be our future leaders. Toyota also values education.” Tayob said this was just the beginning, and that the dealership is planning more projects. “We are in communication with a needy school in Praktiseer. We will reveal plans on how we will assist them. Our aim
is to see improvements in this town and its neighbouring communities.” Burgersfort Toyota urged businesses also to become involved in improving the town. To see more celebrations on social media, simply search for #toyotaturns60.
