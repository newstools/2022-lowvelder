Since the athletic season started, Riverview Preparatory School’s athletes faced every meeting as a new challenge to prepare for the small-school interprimary. In preparation for the interprimary, four athletics meetings were held at Laerskool Malelane, at which Riverview competed with big and small schools from around the Onderberg and parts of Mbombela. These meetings were each one of four stages: the sub-circuit, circuit, sub-district and district athletics meetings. Each athlete had to reach a specific Athletics South Africa (ASA) system score on their track or field items in order for them to move onto the next meeting. Riverview started the first district athletics meeting with 30 athletes.

The circuit meeting followed on January 25 and nine of Riverview’s athletes made it to the next round. On February 8, the sub-district meeting took place, and only two advanced to the final round. Olivia Scheepers and Gift Silinda will be representing Riverview. Olivia will attempt to reach gold, silver or bronze in the girls u/12 shot-put and Gift will compete in the 100m, 200m, high jump and long jump for her school.
