Going to school with torn schoolbags will be a thing of the past for the learners of Nkambeni Primary School, Majika Primary School and Sibukoseftu Secondary School. This is through the generous donation by the Nonyane Foundation in partnership with Hero Networks24. These organisations donated over 200 schoolbags to learners from these public schools on Saturday January 29. The Nonyane Foundation is a non-governmental organisation aimed at reaching out to the indigent and vulnerable by contributing and offering them basic human needs. The initiative to donate schoolbags was established after the co-founder of the organisation, Victoria Nonyane, had noticed the great need for schoolbags within and around the Hazyview area.

That is when I got to see that most learners either have bags that are bigger than they are, or carry their books in plastic bags,” she said.

The EFF’s provincial leader, Collen Sedibe, who was part of the handover, pledged R50 000 that will be used towards the organisation’s developmental projects.
