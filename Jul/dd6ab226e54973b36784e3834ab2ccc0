The Ehlanzeni Police Diving Unit is out at a dam in Barberton to search for a man who went missing while fishing on Monday July 18. It is thought that the man either drowned or was dragged into the dam by crocodiles. The diving unit has been on the scene since the incident was first reported on Monday however, the team has been unable to dive due to the crocodile-infested waters, the amount of sewage, and the overgrown grass and weeds covering much of the dam’s surface. The dam wall has been broken in an attempt to drain it and find the body. This is a developing story and an update will be provided as soon as more information becomes available.
