The Ward 16 councillor in Mbomebla, Kyle Olivier, said the ditch in Henshall street remains open, causing unnecessary traffic and and a danger to motorists. The road was dug up by Silulumanzi when a water pipe burst at the intersection of Brander and Henshall streets.
The supplier repaired the pipes and had to repair the road surface, and appointed a contractor to do so.
This was expected to be completed in a few days, but this did not happen as they only repaired the Brader side and left the two potholes in the middle of the road in Henshall Street.

The two parties agreed to come on board to repair the surface. Silulumanzi promised that its officials would be on-site on Wednesday to compact the soil while the CoM tarred the road,” Olivier said.
The spokesperson for the City of Mbombela, Joseph Ngala, previously said the contractor appointed by Silulumanzi to perform the repairs would be on-site by Thursday June 30.

However, there was a misunderstanding between the Silulumanzi and CoM about who is supposed to repair the two potholes in Henshall Street.
“The intersection was supposed to have been done by CoM, which resulted in Silulumanzi not filling the holes at the time.The two potholes in middle of road surface will be stabilised by our contractor on Thursday July 28, then the CoM will tar the road,” he said.
