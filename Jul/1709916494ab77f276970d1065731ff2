Dr Enos Mabuza Drive is finally open and free of roadworks for the first time since the upgrades had begun in January 2020. The project to widen the road between the Johanna Drive intersection and the R40 was supposed to have been completed in 18 months, by October 2021, however, due to several delays including the moving of sensitive cables and heavy rain, the completion date was pushed forward all the way to 2022. In February this year, the City of Mbombela’s spokesperson, Joseph Ngala, said certain issues had caused a few delays and the 18-month contract with White Hazy Construction had been extended by 136 days.

We are busy with the walkways and paving now,” he said. “We could have been done much sooner, but we could not work on certain sections of the road until electric cables and Telkom cables were moved. Telkom took about 14 months to move the cables and the electric cables were moved over 18 months,” he said. Visser added that the tropical storm Eloise had also created delays in 2021. “We are not constructing speed bumps, as they are not allowed on any four-lane roads. We have created a raised pedestrian crossing as requested by the traffic department.” ALSO READ: Hone your drawing skills with Lowveld Figure Drawing Traffic signalling, walkways and curbing, the road shoulders and the rehabilitation of the area still needs to be done. Visser said they are also busy with the paving, which will be a two-metre walkway that will feature guard railings for pedestrians.
