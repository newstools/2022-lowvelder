The roadblocks caused by protesting taxi drivers over the recent fuel price increase are constantly changing as roads are reopened and then blocked again. Lowveld Security Joint Operation Command (JOC) said the safest course of action is to avoid travel where possible as disruptive actions are predicted to continue throughout the day. Most of the main roads around Mbombela to other towns are being closed almost as soon as they are opened again.
