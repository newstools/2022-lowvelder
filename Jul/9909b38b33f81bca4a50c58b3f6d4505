SEKHUKHUNE – Limpopo education MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya has thanked educators for their dedication and the extra effort taken to assist matric learners with their catch-up programme. The MEC visited Makgwahleng and Seagotle secondary schools on the final day of the winter enrichment classes on July 8. The two walk-in centres had over 480 matric learners from various schools. They were part of the 426 camps set by the department in the 10 education districts to assist learners with extra lessons in an endeavour to improve matric result. The two-week-long programme had designed lessons offered by expert subject teachers with an excellent track record. Four thousand teachers were responsible for just over 112 000 matric learners expected to write their final examinations atthe end of the year. Lerule-Ramkhanya used the opportunity to encourage learners to take their lessons seriously and continue with the study groups in preparation for the trial and final examinations. The MEC urged parents to also monitor and support their children and to ensure that they were afforded enough time to study and rest.
