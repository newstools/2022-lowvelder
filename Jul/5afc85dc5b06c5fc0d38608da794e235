Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM) initially indicated that it would be finished in January. The next estimated date of completion was the end of May. It is evident to all homeowners and road users that the refurbishment of De Beer Street is far from finished. Concrete pavers were left on the curb and some have not been placed correctly in the ditches that have already been dug for them. Most of them are standing at upright angles, which may cause serious damage to vehicles. On Monday June 27, Themba Sibiya, TCLM’s spokesperson, said, “The contractors left and nothing has been done in the past six weeks.”  Upon further enquiries, the DA councillor of Ward 14, Marius Opperman, said there is allegedly a continuing feud between the contractor and subcontractor. According to him, an interdict was granted to keep the subcontractor from the site. “We were pushing very hard for these projects to commence, and the beginning of the new financial year couldn’t come at a better time. More street replacement projects will follow soon according to a set schedule,” said Opperman. Steelburger/Lydenburg News yet again requested an updated response from TCLM and will keep its readers posted.
