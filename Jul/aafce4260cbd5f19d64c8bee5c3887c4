A shack owner said a lit candle that fell over could have been the cause of his dwelling going up in flames on Monday July 18 at 19:30. He tried to salvage what he could before he and his neighbours had to watch most of his possession being destroyed. The Thaba Chweu Fire and Rescue Services were called to the scene and extinguished the remaining flames. Themba Sibiya, Thaba Chweu Local Municipality’s spokesperson, confirmed that the fire unit had been to the scene and nobody was injured. “Disaster management will reach out to the man and see how the municipality can assist him. We want to warn residents to be very careful with open flames when they use candles. Fires like these are more common in the winter months,” said Sibiya.
