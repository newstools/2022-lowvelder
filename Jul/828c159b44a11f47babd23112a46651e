The roadworks on Dr Enos Mabuza Drive are set to be finished by Tuesday July 5. Upgrades to the road first began in February 2020 and included widening the road and upgrading walkways, road shoulders, curbing, and traffic and street lights. The work, which has caused some traffic backlogs and lane restrictions for road users, is all done save for a small section of road near the entrance to the Westend SPAR. White Hazy Construction’s Japie Visser said all the other lanes were completed and open for motorists.  “It is just a small section that we are busy with, and we expect to be done with it by next Tuesday, Friday at the latest, and then we will be off the road,” he said. ALSO READ: Skukuza staff member attacked by leopard Visser said once they have completed it, they will continue with the walkways and street lights, but that this would not affect traffic in any way.
He said the contractors had dealt with several delays due to heavy rain throughout the beginning of the year, but thanked the community for their patience, support and understanding.
