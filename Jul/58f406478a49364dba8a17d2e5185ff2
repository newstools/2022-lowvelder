The song that everyone is talking about, is called “No Weapon”. It was released as a single in October 2021 and has since become a hit on national radio stations. Mnisi was born in Bushbuckridge and matriculated at the Bondzeni High School.
He has been a resident of Mashishing for a number of years where he lives with his wife, Nokuthula, and young children Anteo, Theo and Nhlelo. His passion for music grew stronger when he started working closely with people like Bp Benjamin Dube, the late Vuyo Mokoena and Keke. He is a regular feature at gospel festivals around the country as well as in eSwatini, in Mozambique and Swaziland.
“My gospel career is growing by leaps and bounds and I am so thankful to God and my family. Success is not possible without putting in hard work and dedication. I hope to release a full album in the near future and am looking forward to filming a music video of “No Weapon” within the next few months,” said Mnisi.
