On Friday July 8, the teachers and learners of Skhila Secondary School arrived at school to find damages to its restroom facilities due to a fire. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown. The learners have not been able to use the restrooms for the past three weeks. “The incident left us without toilets, plumbing, electricity and doors. We need building material and a new roof. We see it as a disaster that the learners are not able to use the restrooms. We have made temporary arrangements, but if a business or sponsor can assist the school, we will more than appreciate it,” said Magdeline Khoza, principal. The request for a donation to rebuild is with the permission of the Department of Education.
