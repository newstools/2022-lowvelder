According to Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, one of the suspects was stoned to death, but the police did not release his name. One of the remaining nine managed to escape the mob as they chased him through the village. This suspect (26) was apprehended at the Jane Furse Hospital. The security personnel and police arrested him at gunpoint. Members of the Limpopo Highway Patrol in Sekhukhune, Jane Furse SAPS, and the Operational Response Services joined forces in the operation. The remaining eight were also attacked by the mob, but they managed to flee the scene using a bakkie. The vehicle was later found abandoned in Mamone Village. The hunt for them continues. “The speedy reaction by the members that led to the arrest of the suspect, is highly commendable. The remaining suspects must be hunted down and brought to book. We, however, strongly warn community members to desist from taking the law into their own hands and urge them to instead work with the police to fight crime,” said Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, the Limpopo provincial police commissioner. Stokvel members are advised to refrain from withdrawing and handling large amounts of cash for the purpose of dividing it among themselves. When possible, the stokvel must resort to bank transactions and not handle cash. Cases of murder, armed robbery, and possession of illegal firearms and ammunition have been opened. The suspect is expected to appear in the Sekhukhune Magistrate’s Court this week, facing charges of armed robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the remaining suspects involved should contact Detective Warrant Officer Enoch Mashilo on 082 319 9526, the Crime Stop number on 0860 010 111, or call the nearest police station.
