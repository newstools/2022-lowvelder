In honour of the Pumas being South Africa’s new 2022 Currie Cup champions and Madiba Day being celebrated on July 18, TRACN4 has painted Old Joe as Nelson Mandela wearing a Pumas rugby shirt. “TRAC painted Old Joe earlier this month as Madiba in celebration of Madiba Day on 18 July – a day South Africans have been celebrating for years,” said a Facebook post by TRACN4.

This also goes hand in hand with the fact that Madiba wore a Springbok shirt at the 1995 World Cup, which the nation applauded him for. “Winning the Currie Cup is huge. Doing good for others is too, and that is what Old Joe is commemorating,” the post said.
