Church Unlimited Nelspruit hosted a Holiday Bible Club from July 11 to 15 at its premises, much to the enjoyment of all the children who attended it. The days consisted of crafts and a bunch of fun play activities that had the kids running around and enjoying some outside time.  Etienne Garnett-Bennett of the church said the kids could attend different days or choose to come for the whole week.

It happens once a year during the July school holiday. Do you have more information about the story? Please send us an email to editorial@lowvelder.co.za.
