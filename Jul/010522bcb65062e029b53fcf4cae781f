This project is in line with the mine’s priority to empower its host communities by providing solutions to some of the issues they face. The new school project will replace the existing school building which is currently in an impaired condition and will be used by Umsimbithi for mining activities. The sod-turning event was held at the Wonderfontein Community Hall and was attended by Umsimbithi Mining management team including Thato Gama (Umsimbithi Mining chief executive officer), Lucy Moyane (Mpumalanga Department of Education), Joseph Mabila (acting executive mayor for eMakhazeni Local Municipality) and the Môrelig Combined School acting principal, the school governing body, teachers and local community members. Gama, acknowledged and thanked the community as well as the eMakhazeni local municipality for their engagement and support towards the Môrelig Combined School building project. “We have gathered today to reaffirm our commitment by commencing with the Môrelig Combined School building project. This is certainly a day for celebration and we are very pleased and excited to know that this school will be the start of a new chapter not just for the learners, but the community as a whole,” said Gama.  Mayivuthe Rospa JV was appointed as the main contractor responsible for this project, and they have committed to carving out opportunities for job creation for local companies, starting with eMakhazeni-based companies right at our doorstep. This ensures that there will be shared value for the people of this community which is very important to us as Umsimbithi Mining. The new school building will include the following: five classroom blocks, 20 classrooms, multi-purpose school hall laboratory, and a multimedia centre, two ablution blocks for the boys and girls, an administration block, Grade R classrooms, a guardhouse and a refuse area.
