Three local ringball players have made Tubatse proud. They participated for Ehlanzeni in the National
Ringball Tournament between July 4 and 9. Annika van Vreden, Wené van Vreden and Miané Richter of the Vikings Junior Ringball team are future stars in the sport. “These three ladies were in the U15 team. Annika was also selected as the Ehlanzeni U15 captain. She is the only one selected to play for the U15 SA invitational team,” confirmed her coach, Louis van der Mescht. “We as the Vikings are very proud of them. This was the first year they participated in ringball. They held the Vikings name high and showed their worth.
“A special congratulations to Annika. Don’t stop working hard. We believe in you.” According to the mentor, this young lady might be in need of sponsorship.
“We would also like to humbly ask you that if Annika comes knocking on your door for a donation, to please open your hearts and help her to be able to complete this journey.”
