Carpe Diem Primary School’s learners and teachers were treated to a snake demonstration on June 24. Much to the delight (and sometimes fright) of both the children and educators, Tiaan Joubert of TM Snakes brought a few of his reptiles for show-and-tell.  Joubert started off with some ground rules for what and what not to do when encountering snakes, as well as some educational tidbits about these fascinating creatures.

Some learners were also handed snake skins, which they walked around with so their friends could touch them. Joubert explained where the different snakes he brought were originally from, where they could be found around the Lowveld, and what should be done when you come across one.
