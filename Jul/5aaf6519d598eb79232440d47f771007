Thaba Moshate Hotel Casino and Convention Resort values education and the well-being of locals.  The casino has once again invested in one of the local schools. As part of their CSI projects, Thaba Moshate has refurbished bathrooms, showers and toilets at Rehlahleng Special School. The management of the casino officially handed over the improved facilities on April 28. “We previously had other projects at this school. This recent project sees the kids enjoying flushing toilets and bathrooms that were improved by Thaba Moshate. “We will continue working closely with Rehlahleng to ensure the disabled and needy children are well taken care of. “It was a special time to see the pupils faces light up after seeing the upgrades,” said the casino’s marketing manager, Karabo Tjie. “We’re proud to be part of the school’s principal, Nomonde Bembe, thanked Thaba Moshate for always assisting when they are in need. “It took just a phone call to convince them to assist us. We are relieved the project is complete and our children will enjoy the luxury and comfort of using nice bathrooms and toilets. We will surely take good care and ensure these facilities last for more years. “We thank the management of Thaba Moshate for investing in education.” In showing their appreciation, Rehlahleng’s pupils partook in extramural activities and sang and chanted to the visitors. The day’s activities ended with Thaba Moshate management sharing a meal with the educators, the school management team and the pupils. Rehlahleng is one of few boarding schools in Tubatse that caters for disabled pupils. The school is situated at Ga-Mampuru in Steelpoort.
