He is already the managing director of Perfect Sound Radio Studio in his township, Praktiseer. “I am currently the most talked about hip-hop artist in my home town. I have come a long way in music. It has been a dream and a goal for me to be able to grow my brand and podcast.” Among his hit songs is “Kea Gopola”. He said the song describes his life. “I went deep and found myself describing the challenges and triumphs I encountered in my life. I faced obstacles that I thought I would never overcome. “There were people who told me I would not become anything but remain a local artist. “There was a time I wanted to give up on everything, but did not! I have always had a deep passion for music. “I grew up watching and admiring the likes of Cassper Nyovest, Lection, Fifi Coopper, Master KG and Simangolicious achieving success in music,” said the young artist. Another song from StarSakazi loved by locals is “Mopedi Thwiii”. In the song he raps in Sepedi from start to finish. He appreciates the Bapedi culture and celebrates their tradition. “I used my home language for the track, because I am proud of my language and will fight to protect Sepedi and its rich culture.” “Mopedi Thwii” is being played all over Mzansi radios. The song made locals start admiring Dibakoane’s talent. StarSakazi is planning to shoot music videos for his two songs before the end of 2022. “As an emerging artist, I plead for financial assistance or equipment such as cameras to produce the music videos. “Anyone who wishes to sponsor my projects or Perfect Sound Radio Records, can engage me on 071 035 7200 or on Facebook @ Perfect Sound Radio Records.”
