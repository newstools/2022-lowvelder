Curro Nelspruit’s Sycamore Theatre was transformed into the mystical world of Nelspruitonia as the school brought Cinderella – The Pantomime to life.
Filled with witty jokes and clever insults between the characters, the performance kept the crowd entertained and engaged. In case you were unsure of what your reaction as an audience member should be, a Pierrot-like character played the role of an audience prompter, jumping out from stage left holding signs with instructions like “Gasp!”, “Laugh!”, “Applause!”, “Awww!” and many besides.

The story followed much of what you would expect from the Cinderella plot, but with a few choice additions, like a best friend falling in love with her, some male citizens queuing for the glass slipper fitting, and a ghost haunting the room of the unibrowed ugly stepsisters.
