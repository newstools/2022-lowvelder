After almost five days of searching a sewerage- and crocodile-infested dam for the body of a missing fisherman, the Ehlanzeni Police Diving Unit recovered the body on Friday morning, July 22. The man had gone fishing at a dam in Barberton on Monday July 18 when he went missing. It was presumed he had either drowned or had been dragged into the water and killed by crocodiles. The divers from the unit waded through the sewerage-filled dam, while community members stood at the banks watching for crocodiles.

The diving unit had been on the scene since the incident was first reported on Monday, however, the team had been unable to dive due to the crocodile-infested waters, the amount of sewage and the overgrown grass and weeds covering much of the dam’s surface.
