SEKHUKHUNE – The Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders has elected Hosi Pheni Ngove as its new chairperson on Monday. Ngove replaces Kgoshi Malesela Dikgale. He was elected in a sitting to reconstitute the sixth House of Traditional Leaders presided over by the MEC for the Department of Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and
Traditional Affairs, Basikopo Makamu, on behalf of Limpopo Premier Chupu Stanley Mathabatha. Thirty-six representatives from Limpopo’s five districts in the Local House of Traditional Leaders competed for the
position. In a secret ballot election co-ordinated by the Independent Electoral Commission, the house elected Ngove as chairperson and Kgoshi Boleu Rammupudu as the new deputy chairperson. Additionally, Kgoshi Dikgale, Inkosi Mahlangu and Thovhele Rambuda have been elected to represent the provincial house in the National House of Traditional and Khoisan leaders. Mathabatha reasserted the standing of the house as a cornerstone of democracy, one that connects government to the people on the ground. “I want to congratulate the newly elected leadership and assure them that together we shall grow Limpopo into the giant it is becoming,” said Mathabatha. Makamu expressed his gratitude towards the former chairperson of the house, Kgoshi Malesela Dikgale,
and his executive. “We had challenges we faced as government and the house; however, your leadership was always open, honest
and willing to deliberate with us. We encourage the new executive to continue where you left off for the benefit of our people.” The Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders is a statutory body charged with the responsibility of advising the
government and the legislature on matters related to customs, tradition and culture, including developmental initiatives that have an impact on rural communities. The new leadership will serve for a period of five years.
