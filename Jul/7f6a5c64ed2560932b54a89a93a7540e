BURGERSFORT – Following recent concerns about the Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality’s (FTLM) provision of service delivery and maintenance of its infrastructure, it has started improving some of its
internal roads. The FTLM said on Monday it was revamping the road next to the Long Distance Taxi Rank. Steelburger/Lydenburg News understands that upgrades are currently taking place on that street
and on other ones in town. Locals had previously complained about the road and the leaking sewage on it. “The upgrades will assist with the busy traffic in town,” said Burgersfort Ext 10 resident Peter Moila. “They also have to ensure the leaking sewers are fixed as well as remove the uncollected
rubbish bins.”
