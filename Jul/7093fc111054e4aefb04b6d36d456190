The Independent Development Trust’s spokesperson, Phasha Mokgolane, said a cash flow issue and delayed laboratory reports are hampering the progress on Koraalboom Avenue. Mokgolane said the closing of the ditches at the TVET College access road, including the Koraalboom Avenue to the Mbombela High Court, was supposed to be finished by the end of June.  “The contractor is still on-site, since he had challenges in terms of his cash flow, and the work done had to be redone as base stabilisation had since failed due to the adverse weather conditions Mbombela had endured in the past few months,” he said.

He also dismissed allegations that the contractor was fully paid before having finished the work.  “According to the project cost report, the contractor has been paid 76% of the approved cost. We did not pay him the full amount while they were still working – we usually pay the contractor according to the work done,” he said.
