The police are investigating an incident in which two residents were shot at by armed men in West Acres yesterday evening, July 18. A man and his brother-in-law had just arrived at the gate to their property in West Acres at about 19:10, when a Toyota Etios Cross pulled up behind them. Two men allegedly got out of the vehicle and began shooting at them. One resident’s quick thinking saw him reverse out the driveway and up the road to avoid the gunmen.
