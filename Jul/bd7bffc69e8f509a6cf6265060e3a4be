After the horrific disaster of 21 young people being killed in a tavern in KwaZulu-Natal (June 25) and 13 people in a Sowetan community hall (June 7), a delegation of different church denominations reached out to the local community. As part of Nelson Mandela International Day on Monday July 18, they walked to different shebeens and taverns in the greater Mashishing area. St John’s Anglican Church, the Methodist Church, the Roman Catholic Church, St Paul’s Anglican Church, Holy Zion Church and the Jehova Olam Christian Church. “We prayed for South Africa and for everyone in Thaba Chweu. Religion is not something you walk around with in your heart and keep to yourself – it is a beautiful feeling and experience. We believe that in prayer we can strengthen these young men and women who support these establishments to make better choices in life,” said Rev Anna William of St John’s Anglican Church.
