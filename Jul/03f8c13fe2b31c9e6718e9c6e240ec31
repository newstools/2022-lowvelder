The Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality (FTLM) is expected to pay a service provider R2 000 for a single container of five litres of hydraulic oil. The payment is for a service rendered in December 2019. The municipality is also expected to pay another service provider R16 250 for five units of Epson fx-2190 ribbon cartridges. The funds have been rendered outstanding by the municipality’s Apel Regional Office. According to the opposition parties, the service had already been rendered and the FTLM has obligations to pay it.

According to the party leader, Seun Mogotji, this is a waste of taxpayer’s money and the matter should be reported and investigated by the Municipal Public Accounts Committee. “FTLM never ceases to amaze with the manner in which they do things. As if losing R231m in the VBS saga was not enough loss and embarrassment, now they want to back-pay a service provider who in 2019 provided the municipality with five litres oil at an obviously inflated cost of R2 000. That must be some magic oil mixed with gold particles for it to cost that much. “We can’t allow such wasteful expenditure to happen on our watch. The cost of this oil is abnormal, whichever way you look at it, yet FTLM sees nothing wrong and are ready to foot the bill.” Mogotji said hydraulic oil normally cost R400 or less. “That was back in 2019, surely the prices were slightly lower then.” Speaking on national radio Thobela FM, FTLM’s spokesperson, Kubane Tolo, said the municipality has purchased a special hydraulic oil for a grader machine that had a breakdown.
