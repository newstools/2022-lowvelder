After a year of planning and many challenges due to Covid complications, visas were approved, tickets were booked and bags were packed for 11 South African participants to attend the International Talent Showcase (ITS) in Tampa, Florida. Six of these participants were scouted at the recent Lowvelder’s Got Talent event held in Mbombela by the director of ITS via a live video stream. Candice Paterson, one of the owners of Master Models, said the last year involved much training and planning, but was all worthwhile. “Year on year the South African team does well, but this year a new benchmark was reached in terms of achievement, contracts and bursaries. “I am extremely proud of each participant. The knowledge and experience gained is priceless in equipping the participants with a life-changing experience.
