SEKHUKHUNE – Two men, one a policeman, appeared in the Nebo Magistrate’s Court last Thursday on several charges. Modirelwa Maxwell Mokoana (42) and Sergeant Thabo Letudi Mokoana (40) of Benoni Police Station appeared in the Nebo Magistrate’s Court for a formal bail application. The duo appeared on charges of kidnapping, murder and defeating the ends of justice. The incident took place in the Kgaphamadi Village in Sekhukhune in May. The accused were arrested on June 31. “It is alleged that Refiloe Malope, a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community, was chased by one of the accused’s motor vehicles. She was screaming for help. She was apprehended and shoved into the boot of the car. Malope was later found dead in a discontinued ventilation mineshaft in Benoni,” said Limpopo National Prosecuting Authority’s spokesperson, Mashudu Malabi Dzhangi. The matter was postponed to July 28 for a further bail hearing, as the defence lawyer was not in court. The accused will remain in custody until then.
