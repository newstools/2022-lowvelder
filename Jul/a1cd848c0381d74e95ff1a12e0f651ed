John Leonard du Plooy, formerly a co-accused in the Hetta Potgieter murder trial, faced the Roodepoort Regional Court on similar charges yesterday, July 7. He will remain behind bars in Johannesburg Prison until his next court appearance on murder and aggravated robbery charges on July 22. Du Plooy was previously featured in Lowvelder news reports as the co-accused of Shaun Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen was convicted for the 2018 murder of Potgieter who had lived in Macadamia Old Age Home. Charges against Du Plooy had been withdrawn due to insufficient evidence. The two had been dubbed the “Old age home killers” following the investigation of multiple murders of four elderly women from different old ages homes (in both Mpumalanga and Gauteng) between 2018 and 2019. It was the August 2018 murder of Lillas Jane Merry that led to Du Plooy’s most recent court appearance.

These were committed in June and September 2018. Oosthuizen was sentenced to four direct life imprisonments plus 80 years’ imprisonment by the Pretoria Regional Court on May 16.

Mokoena further urged anyone who is responsible for the safeguarding of the elderly to take extra precautions as they cannot fight for themselves.
