The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has lashed out at the state and the police for dragging their feet in solving the Hillary Gardee’s murder case. Addressing hundreds of EFF members outside the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Friday July 22, the party’s national deputy secretary general, Poppy Mailola, said they were very disappointed at the manner in which the case is unfolding and how slow the wheels of justice are turning. Mailola said the EFF has time and again tried to help the state with solid evidence to build a strong case against all suspects involved in the kidnapping, rape and murder of Gardee, but they (police) are moving on a snail’s pace to get the case to trial. Mailola was addressing the party membership just after the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court postponed the bail hearing of the three accused. Sipho Mkhatshwa, Philemon Lukhele and Albert Gama were remanded to Monday July 25 and Wednesday July 27, respectively.

The case has been postponed yet again and I must say that we are very disappointed because every time we come to court, this means that the Gardee family has to relive the painful experiences they suffered. It really brings the family pain and reminds them of the horror that their child had just gone through,” said Mailola. She was accompanied to court by the party’s provincial leadership, led by Collen Sedibe and acting secretary, Ntsako Mkhabela.

Furthermore, the family is doing everything in their power to help the state gather concrete evidence so that we can go to trial,” continued Mailola.
