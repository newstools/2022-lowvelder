Three bodies burned beyond recognition were found in a car on a farm in Pienaar on Friday July 15. A provincial police spokesperson, Colonel Donald Mdhluli, said the police are investigating three counts of murder following the discovery. Mdhluli said it was reported that a worker had arrived at the farm at 14:00 and noticed that the gate to the property was open. The farmworker had allegedly last been on the farm on Monday July 11 and had locked the gate when he left. “On closer inspection, the farmworker realised that there was a car, a Hyundai i10, that was burnt,” said Mdhluli. The worker then noticed the vehicle held burnt human remains. The man alerted the Mpumalanga police immediately and upon their arrival, it was discovered that there were three bodies in the car: one in the driver’s seat, one in the passenger’s seat and one in the boot. “The identities of the three are unknown at this stage. The circumstances surrounding this incident are being investigated by the police. The motive for the killing is also currently unknown,” said Mdhluli. He said the police are urging anyone with information to call the Crime Stop number on 08600 10111 or to.send information via the My SAPS app. All received information will be treated as confidential and callers may opt to remain anonymous. The provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Semakaleng Manamela, strongly condemned the incident and called for the swift arrest of the suspects. “This is a horrible incident and a team of experts has been assembled to investigate this case and trace the perpetrators of this heinous crime,” she said. “The perpetrators should be hunted down and brought to book.”
