Motorists, including truck drivers, are cautioned to be extra careful especially on the R548, the R42 and the N12 near Delmas, as well as on the N4 and Bethal Road near Middelburg, where these incidents are prevalent.
Tendencies were also reported on the R36, between Dullstroom and Lydenburg.
The warning comes after a number of truck drivers reported that when they stopped next to the road either to relieve themselves or to stretch their legs, a group of suspects emerged from the bushes and held them at gunpoint. There were also incidents in which hijackers would inform the truck drivers that there was something wrong with their trailers and as they stop the suspects would pounce on them.
At times the suspects would cut the fuel pipes of the trucks so that the diesel drains out. In these incidents, batteries and cell phones would be taken from the victims.
The request was that the community should be vigilant and avoid stopping next to the road for any reason, especially in the areas indicated. In the meantime, police are dealing with the situation and working hard to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book.
Three suspects, Fortune Nzima (32), Tebogo Moshia (28) and Bonny Motsepe (28) were arrested for a truck hijacking which occurred on March 18 in Middelburg. This was just one of many efforts by police to fight the scourge. Police urged anyone with information that may assist in arresting suspects of these crimes to call 013-249 1600/1/2/4 or call the Crime Stop number on 08600 10111.
