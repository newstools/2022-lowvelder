The Ward 16 councillor, Kyle Olivier, said the worksite where a broken pipe had been repaired in Henshall Street, had not yet been fully retarred. All lanes in Piet Retief Street are now open for traffic after a leak there had also resulted in a lane being closed.  According to Olivier, the contractor was waiting for asphalt to close the repairs after the underground pipe burst in Henshall Street.  “The contractor has covered the area with soil so motorists can use the road while they are waiting for tar to cover it up. They were supposed to be done by Wednesday, but they were disturbed by the taxi strike. Hopefully they will complete the repair before the end of this week,” he said.
