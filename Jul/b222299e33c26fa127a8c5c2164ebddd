Family and friends remembered award-winning actor, playwright and director Mncedisi Baldwin Shabangu at a memorial service at KaNyamazane Alliance Church of South Africa on Wednesday July 28. During the service, speakers shared their memories about Shabangu and there were various performances done to celebrate his life.
Fellow actors Charles Phasha, Sibusiso Black Madondo and Vuyisile Mshudulu attended and paid their respects.  Mshudulu said he was an authentic human being. “He used his talent to change people’s lives, and there are so many lives that he touched and changed. There are so many people who believe in themselves because they met Mncedisi. He ignited many spaces, in the country, in the continent and in the world.”
He said they were in KaNyamazane so that the family and people who had grown up with Shabangu would know that he was loved.
Stephen Mashaba of the PAC said they used to be childhood friends and he was an exceptional person.  “He could have studied any degree and he would have passed because he was gifted, although he chose passion, and it was acting. He made sure that he excelled.” Sibusiso Sumbane of Mbombela Municipality Youth Desk said as the Government they had not done Shabangu justice.
