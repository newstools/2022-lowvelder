TRACN4 has urged motorists to avoid travelling on the N4 today. This follows road closures across Mbombela this morning, July 6, due to protests surrounding the recent fuel price increase. TRACN4’s Solange Soares said the entire N4 is basically closed due to the protest action.
She said the road closures include Machadodorp, the tunnel at Emgwenya (Waterval Boven), the Montrose intersection and Karino.
