Kabouterland Nursery School recently thanked each and every one of its parents, the little kabouters and staff members who contributed to their food drive for White River SPCA. “The White River SPCA is in dire need of contributions. It warms our hearts to know that we have such a caring Kabouterland family,” the school said.
“We know that many homeless dogs and cats will now be able to receive their much-needed nutrition. Thank you also to the SPCA staff who offer their time and their hearts to help these lonely animals. Thank you all for caring.” ALSO READ: Hone your drawing skills with Lowveld Figure Drawing
