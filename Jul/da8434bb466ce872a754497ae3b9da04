ATOK – A total of 24 zama zamas aged between 19 and 54 appeared in the Sekhukhune Magistrate’s Court on Thursday on charges of illegal mining. They also face charges of possession of suspected illegal mining equipment and chrome, and contravention of the Immigration Act. The suspects were remanded in custody and the case has been postponed to July 29 for bail application.
They were arrested in Atok under the Apel policing area on July 20 during concerted efforts by the Limpopo police to clamp down on illegal mining. The operation led to confiscation of mining equipment and unprocessed chrome. “The operation was a joint effort between the SAPS, the departments of home affairs and mineral resources, immigration officials, EMS and Phoenix Mine’s security.
“The various police units involved included a tactical response team, the Hawks, Public Order Police, detectives and an explosives unit,” said Limpopo SAPS spokesperson, Colonel Malesela Ledwaba. He said 22 of the arrested suspects were found to be in the country illegally and will face additional charges of contravening the Immigration Act. The police confiscated 13 jackhammers, seven buckets, a generator, 11 shovels, three electrical cords, chrome and
R16 450 in cash. The provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, has welcomed the success of the operation and commended all the members involved. “Community members are warned to desist from engaging in these illegal activities. The SAPS will persistently conduct similar operations in all affected areas with the aim of bringing the perpetrators to book. I therefore appeal to members of the community to report these illegal activities immediately to the police,” said Hadebe.
The operation continues.
