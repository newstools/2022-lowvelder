Entries for Lydenburg’s Got Talent (LGT) close on Monday August 1.
LGT has secured sponsorship from AE Switch, thereby securing exciting cash prizes for the winners in each category. The judges will be announced next week in Steelburger/Lydenburg News. They are all renowned professionals in the entertainment industry. On Friday July 22, the Rosemarie Middleton Dance Centre (RMDC) held a cake and candy sale to raise funds for costumes and accessories. “We are super excited and looking forward to LGT. Lydenburg will never be the same and all the arrangements are falling into place. This is for the town. And I hope that whoever reads this realises that their talent is worthy of entering this competition,” said Rosemarie Middleton. This is a talent show for every dancer, actor, singer, and entertainer in the greater Lydenburg area. The ultimate talent will be showcased during Lydenburg’s Got Talent from Tuesday to Saturday August 16 to 20. This event is open to all age groups, including adults. Certificates and reports will be awarded throughout the week. At the gala event on Saturday, the crème de la crème will receive trophies, cash prizes and medals.
