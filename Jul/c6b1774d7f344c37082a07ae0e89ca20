Locals gathered at the pub with their potjies and various meats and vegetables at 13:00 on Sunday, forming five teams to take part. The event even had some stallholders selling candyfloss, sweets and home-made jams and marmalades. While the teams worked on making their best potjiekos yet, local singer Jax performed for the audience, receiving a massive round of applause for her rendition of “Bette Davis Eyes” by Kim Carnes.
