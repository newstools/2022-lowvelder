A girl of Komati Academy, Kwanele Nkosi, has recently won Miss Teen Ehlanzeni for 2022/23 in Mbombela. Corridor Gazette asked this talented youngster to tell her own story. “I am 14 years old and a learner at Komatipoort Academy. I entered the pageant in February last year when I got a spot in the top 32. I also made it through to the top 16 and top 10. I received my finalist sash in July last year and had my very first photo shoot with it. I started doing community service by going to Mhlathi Primary School and donating mathematical sets. I also talked to the young girls about self-care. I got a chance to meet Miss Mpumalanga Heritage and I also took photos with her. She helped me a lot in my journey and I really appreciate her work.
“In 2022, I went to see three families that are unprivileged, and donated food and clothes, and to see their happy faces made me smile.
“The coronation ceremony took place on June 18 last year at St Mark’s International School in Mbombela. We were eight finalists who took part. After elimination rounds of answering tough questions from the judges and modelling on the catwalk, I was crowned as the new Miss Teen Ehlanzeni for 22/23!
“I am excited to bring a change to my community. I am expecting to be a role model and a sister to the community. I am currently a Miss Teen Ehlanzeni brand ambassador. I entered the pageant with the mindset of a learner, but now I am not only a queen, but a leader. I live with the motivation that says ‘shoot for the moon, even if you don’t make it you will land among the stars.’ I am a boss lady!” ALSO READ: Komatipoort leopard is captured and safe
