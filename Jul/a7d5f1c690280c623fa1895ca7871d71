The protest situation has escalated and become volatile and unpredictable.
As a precaution shopping centres and businesses are closing in Mbombela and Hazyview.
It is strongly advised that everybody remains where they are and not venture on the streets. No violence or looting has been reported as yet. Employees who depend on public transport, who managed to report for duty today, will have to make alternative arrangements to return home as taxis are on strike.
