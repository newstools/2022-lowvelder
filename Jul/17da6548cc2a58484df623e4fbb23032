The DA is concerned that service delivery in Mpumalanga is often interrupted and that projects are not completed because provincial departments are continuously struggling with insufficient budgets due to backlogs. The DA spokesperson, Bosman Grobler, said finance and economic development departments are often using the current financial year’s budget to pay service providers for services provided in the previous financial years. “Currently, the provincial departments have R816 589 544 worth of backlogs from the previous financial year. Unfortunately, other services in the province will be compromised as departments will be using money from their current budgets to pay for services rendered in the previous financial year,” he said.
