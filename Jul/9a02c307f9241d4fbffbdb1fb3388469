The provincial South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) is urging beneficiaries not to be misled by social media circulating rumours about the Sassa gold cards going to be discontinued, having expired or being withdrawn. Its spokesperson, Senzeni Ngubeni, said these cards work like any other commercial authenticated card as approved by the South African Reserve Bank. Beneficiaries must know that it is safe, with all necessary safeguards being taken to keep their money in their accounts.

This will enable beneficiaries to use their card to withdraw their money at ATMs and supermarkets using their created Pin. “We request beneficiaries to avoid going into crime hotspots during the first days of the month. Scammers and thugs target vulnerable people living with disability and elders during this time. It is advisable to do shopping or withdraw money in the middle of the month,” he said.
