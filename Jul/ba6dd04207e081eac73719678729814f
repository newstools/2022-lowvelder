 The Grenadier boasts proper 4×4 capability with every stitch and every surface built to get the job done.  This is what the Grenadier exists for. And it explains our approach to building it: A best-in-class BMW straight-six petrol/diesel engine. A ladder-frame chassis. Permanent four-wheel drive. Three locking differentials. Solid beam axles.  We’ve learnt from the best of the past. We partnered with the suppliers that got the brief and created a true utilitarian 4×4 designed for the 21st century – built to go the distance.
