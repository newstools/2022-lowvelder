BURGERSFORT – The Limpopo government has confirmed on Friday June 17 that they will start with the upgrade of the Manoke Tribal Offices at Ga-Manoke Village. At a sod-turning ceremony, the provincial MEC for the Department of Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure, Namane Dickson Masemola, officially assigned a contractor to the construction of the new traditional council offices, that will include a new office building, a guard house, palisade fencing, pavement, parking and a borehole. The Manoke Tribal Offices falls under the Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality (FTLM) in the Sekhukhune District Municipality (SDM). The project is estimated to run for 12 months and work opportunities for at least 25 people will be created, while some local SMMEs will benefit from this. The MEC said the construction of the offices is one way of strengthening the relationship between government and traditional leaders. “This is part of the efforts of the provincial government to provide support to the traditional council authorities to maintain their prestige and authority, but also to enable them to serve their communities better,” said Masemola.
Cllr Kukie Sefala on behalf of the SDM’s executive mayor, Julia Mathebe, thanked Masemola and his team for these crucial administration improvements, which will forge a working partnership with traditional leaders.
Kgoshi Manoke thanked all spheres of government and called on all stakeholders to hold hands and make sure this project is realised. The construction of the tribal offices should be completed at a cost of R10m.
