Here are some accessories parents can stock up to help their children kick-start their school term. 1. Bag to back With more subjects introduced, your child will now need to bring textbooks, workbooks and notebooks to school, on top of his reading book and stationery. That can be quite a load on his shoulder and back. Studies have proved that children’s backpacks should not weigh more than 15% of their body weight. Children are going to carry their school bags for a long time and there are plenty of musculoskeletal problems such scoliosis, which may develop if their bags are more than what they should carry. Pay particular attention to the girls, as they generally weigh less than boys, and therefore are not as strong. 2. Stride on Though most of the time is spent in the classroom, there will be physical education lessons and recess time for the children to run around and be active. Not forgetting the extracurricular activities they might have, it’s a good idea to invest in a good pair of shoes. There are some tips to look out for when shoe shopping: • Go for shoes with fastening support. • Choose those with a patterned or textured sole as this will provide traction and prevent slips on slippery surfaces.• Soles should be sturdy to protect the feet from potential injuries, with some flexibility for it to bend with the foot movement.
