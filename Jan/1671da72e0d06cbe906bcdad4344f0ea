A local couple tragically lost their lives in the early hours of January 29 when a Volvo allegedly careened into their vehicle just a few metres from their home. Charlene Miljo and Kevin Schwan had been on their way home after enjoying a night out when the crash occurred about three kilometres out of Mbombela on the Barberton Road. A close family friend of the couple, Biance Barnard, said Miljo and Schwan had been about 200 metres from home when the driver of a Volvo, travelling from Barberton’s side towards Mbombela, allegedly lost control and crashed into their Ford Figo. It is believed that the couple had died on impact. It is unclear at this stage how many occupants had been in the Volvo or if any injuries were sustained. Barnard said the couple had had so much ahead of them and many dreams to fulfil. “This is so heartbreaking. Everyone is grieving and is still in shock,” she said.  This is a developing story. The full story will be available in Thursday’s Lowvelder.
