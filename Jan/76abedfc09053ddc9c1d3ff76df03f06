Gideon Gouws, the farm manager of Buffelspruit Boerdery, was on his way to work on the R536 near Kiepersol at 05:00 and was surprised when he saw a hippo, walking on the road. He took a video of it and informed the residents in the area to be extra cautious when driving on this route. The hippo walked for a few kilometres, before turned off the road and disappeared into the bush.

I believe someone left their farm gate open during the night,” said Gouws.  According to Gerhard van Staden, Hi-Tech Security manager in Kiepersol, many hippos are spotted in the area, especially during the night when they leave dams to scout for food. “It is far from strange to see a hippo gallivanting on farms and roads, because we live in their area,” Van Staden said.
