The suspects were arrested during a joint operation by the Burgersfort and
Mpumalanga Provincial tactical response teams. The arrest followed a robbery at
a supermarket in Burgersfort at 08:15 on Saturday January 15. Afterwards, the
suspects fled towards Graskop in two vehicles with an undisclosed amount of
cash and cigarettes. “The vehicles were identified by the SAPS. The suspects tried to evade arrest
and fired live rounds of ammunition at the police while driving. The SAPS managed to
intercept their vehicles and the suspects were arrested between Graskop and Burgersfort,”said a SAPS spokesperson, Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, in a statement. Mojapelo said the case will be transferred to the Burgersfort Magistrate’s Court where the suspects will appear on charges of attempted murder, possession of unlawful firearms and ammunition, and possession of suspected stolen firearms and properties. Lt Gen Thembi Hadebe, the provincial police commissioner, thanked the Limpopo
and Mpumalanga SAPS following the arrest.
