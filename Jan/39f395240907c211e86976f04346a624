Angered residents of the Shaga Village and other villages protested by blocking the main roads towards several Limpopo mines on Monday January 17 from 04:00. Tree stumps, branches, buses and heavy vehicles were used to barricade the roads. The community members blocked the R555, Maartinshoop and Sekhukune roads leading to Tweefontein (Samancor), Der Brochen, Helena and Mototolo mines (Anglo American Platinum). Allegedly, the protests were organised by unemployment forums in the area. “At this stage, it is also suspected that the protest can be due to a possible lack of service delivery by the Greater Tubatse Municipality as well as unemployment in the area. The police are monitoring the area,” said Capt Kaizer Moela, a police spokesperson. The police are currently on the scene and assisting with the removal of heavy vehicles and buses. No arrests have been made. *This is a developing story, and Steelburger/Lydenburg News will keep its readers updated.
