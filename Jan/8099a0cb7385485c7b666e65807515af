The head of public transport, chiefs, hawkers and community, Peer Mkhonto, said control over the challenges Hazyview had faced last year would not have been possible were it not for the strong bond between the community and the mall. “A lot of the things we do are for the community, and the only reason the mall and shopping centre are successful, is because of the full support we have from the seven chiefs and tribes surrounding Hazyview,” said Mkhonto. The first project Lowveld Mall will be pursuing is to provide book covers for primary school children. Parents who cannot afford covers for their children’s books will be invited to the mall in January to visit a station where their books will be covered.

Mkhonto and his team plan to visit these schools and provide the necessities they will need to cover the children’s books, as well as some stationery. “We know the struggles parents face when it is back-to-school time for their children, and that is why we will start off the year by helping them out step by step,” he said. Schools surrounding Hazyview can contact the management team to organise book covers for children whose parents would appreciate the support. Do you have more information about the story?
