The collective effort was an initiative by the Lydenburg Mashishing Business Chamber (LMBC). With the slogans “Together we can” and “We care”, the tasks dealt out to the volunteers included raking, shovelling, picking up trash and, most importantly, cutting the long grass obstructing the roadside for motorists. During a brainstorming session and meeting of the executive LMBC committee on Wednesday January 19, it was decided to choose smaller projects that were manageable, to kick off the year.  “Our bigger vision is to beautify the town’s entrances and fix potholes. However, this is just a drop in the bucket. Members of LMBC are reaching out to the mining industry and other organisations for possible contributions. It all depends on the continued support of businesses and the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality. That is why we believe we can do it together,” said Etli van der Merwe, the chairperson. To become involved in the next project and help the business chamber, phone or WhatsApp the administrator André Hanekom, on 084 688 5007.
