STEELPOORT – For the past 40 years, Tingeling Preschool has proved to be among the best schools in Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality. This school has produced architects, attorneys, doctors, engineers and many more professional experts. Pupils are from villages in Steelpoort, Tubatse Residence, Mangabane, Winterveldt, Riba Cross, Praktiseer and other local communities. Having owned the school from the past 16 years, its principal Lu-ann Heyl said Tingeling has improved in the past decades. Heyl who has a passion, dedication and love for the kids, is determined to put the school even more on
the map.  “Our school is more than 40 years old. I took over as the principal 16 years ago and I can confirm that we are offering the best education, care and lots of love for our children. All our classes are in English. Parents can relax at work, knowing their young ones are in safe hands and getting the proper care.” Tingeling accepts children from three months old. The school has more than 11 staff members. It has also recently participated in community projects in which they donated Christmas gifts and blankets to the needy locals in and around Steelpoort. The school has also competed in dance programmes and music competitions on national television.
“The school’s success is first and foremost God, Tingeling is Jesus’ school, even after the big lockdown, we are still open. We are here today because of God,” remarked Heyl. The principal confirmed that for the first time in over 40 years there is a head boy and head girl. She added that one of the future plans is to open schools in Burgersfort and Lydenburg. Registration is still open for children between three months and six years. Interested parents can contact Tingeling on tingpopstar@gmail.com or 072 844 1949.
