Morulaneng All Stars came from two goals down to win the Ga Makofane top 8 soccer tournament. The matches were held at Blue Birds soccer ground from January 8-9. The team from Mabocha defeated
Lockdown FC 1-0 in the quarterfinals. They were pitted against Golden FC in the semi-finals in
which they won the game 2-1. In the final, they locked horns with Royal FC from Sekopung. Royal started the match with a bang, controlling the first half. They scored two goals in succession and were deservedly leading in the interval. A change of formation and tactics from Morulaneng swung the game in their favour. The team packed
the midfield with five players, played with only three defenders and attacked with two forwards. They put too much pressure and were awarded a penalty in the 70th minute. The Mabocha side pushed for an equaliser and were eventually rewarded as they scored with the last
kick of the match that ended 2-2. With the momentum still with All Stars, they were clinical with their
spot kicks. Louis Makofane missed a penalty for Royal FC, with all five players of Morulaneng scoring their
spot kicks. The organiser, Othello Makofane, congratulated Murulaneng for winning the match. He confirmed
to Steelburger/Lydenburg News that they have planned another massive tournament for this weekend.
