An afternoon storm caused a power outage in parts of Mbombela. Lightning struck an outdoor breaker at the Delta Substation yesterday at 14:00. The breaker was totally damaged and had to be replaced. Heavy downpour and thunder made it difficult for the Energy Department team to swiftly fix the breaker, as the residents in Valencia, Steiltes, Nelsville and KaMagugu were left without power.
