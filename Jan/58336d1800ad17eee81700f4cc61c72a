Children and their parents had the opportunity to experience and learn more about the slithering creatures that are found in all areas in the Lowveld. The pop-up park was hosted by Juan de Beer, Jacques Smith, Amber Shepstone and Jan Viljoen of the rescue unit, and the team’s passion for snakes were shared with the children who were fascinated by the beautiful reptiles. Courses were organised for people who wanted to learn how to handle snakes when they had to be removed safely. Chris Hobkirk of Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency hosted the training courses.
