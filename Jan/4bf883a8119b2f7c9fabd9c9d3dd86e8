Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary (CFW) received word from the Kruger National Park on January 20 that it had recovered another orphaned rhino calf. Estimated to have been alone for around a week, the young bull calf had been clawed by lions. “Our newest arrival was spotted in the south and darted by a SANParks vet, Dr Lufunu Netshitavhadulu, before being flown to the nearest gate.
