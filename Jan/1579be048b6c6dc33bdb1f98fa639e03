ER24 has some safety tips to avoid festivity around the water ending in tragedy. On the beach: • Swim when there are lifeguards on duty – this is usually from 10:00 to 18:00.
• Make sure that you are seen by lifeguards in the water. Don’t swim outside the designated swimming area, i.e. outside the flags. This area is chosen because there are no currents and it is outside the surf zones.  • Swimmers need to watch out for surfers and surfers need to watch out for swimmers.
• Don’t drink alcohol on the beach. It’s illegal and extremely dangerous. If under the influence, you may not realise if you are hypothermic and your limbs don’t work as well as they should. By dulling your senses, alcohol may inhibit your ability to sense when your children are in danger.
• Never swim alone.  Around pools: • Never leave kids unsupervised near water.
• Secure your pool area with appropriate barriers that can’t be pushed down by little kids.
• Little ones submerge very quickly. Stay within an arm’s length, especially if the water is murky.
• Make sure kids don’t play rough in the pool and jump on top of one another.
• It is important that adults who supervise must be able to swim.
• Remember that anyone, including people who can swim, are at risk of drowning. CPR: In both instances, learn to do basic CPR. Make sure the person is out of the water, awake and breathing. Shout for help.
