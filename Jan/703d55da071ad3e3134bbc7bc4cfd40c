Sekhukhune United Football Club have confirmed the signing of three players. Babina Noko confirmed the news on their social media pages on Tuesday. “We are delighted to announce the signing of the following players – Justin Shonga from the Egyptian side Ismaily SC, Evans Rusike from SuperSport United FC and defender Luckyboy Mokoena from TS Galaxy,” the club said in a statement. Born in Chipata, Zambia on November 5, 1996, Shonga spent the last four years playing in South Africa for Orlando Pirates, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Cape Town City FC. Evans Rusike (31), born in Chitungwiza, started his career in 2010 with Kiglon before moving to Zimbabwe Saints in 2012. He was last on the books of SuperSport United. Luckyboy Mokoena (28), born in Koppies, Mpumalanga on December 12, 1993, started his youth football career with Mpumalanga Black Aces, Kaizer Chiefs and Bidvest Wits, before playing senior football for Chippa United, Ubuntu Cape Town, Real Kings, Highlands Park and TS Galaxy. Mokoena also donned the colours of South Africa’s Amajita in 2019. Shonga said, “It is an awesome feeling to be back in the DStv Premiership. However, the environment is totally different from Ismaily in the Egyptian Soccer League. “The Egyptian environment is conducive to focus on football. South Africa is more suitable to play football because I feel at home. “My main priority is to help the team to accumulate more points going forward, to finish in a respectable position. However, I will work hard to get my form back so that I can contribute immensely to the team’s success.” Mokoena said that he would like to thank Sekhukhune United’s technical team and management. He also indicated that he will work hard to contribute to the team’s success. His aim with the team is to win some silverware. Rusike said that he is looking forward to an exciting season. He said he will do his best to ensure that Babina Noko stay where they belong.
