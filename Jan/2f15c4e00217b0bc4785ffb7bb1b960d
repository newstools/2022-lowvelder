The falls, in the Donkerhoek area, cascade down where the Crocodile and Kareespruit rivers meet. “It was a great treat and enjoyed by the 16 members and their friends. We were able to spot more than 70 bird species,” said George Skinner, the club chairperson.
“The route to the pristine waterfalls went through beautiful oak lanes and mature farmland to Donkerhoek, where the vulnerable southern bald ibis and the rock martin “waited” for us. The mountain wagtails flew overhead during our walk and other special birds we encountered were olive bushshrike, narina trogon, and purple-crested turacos. They greeted us from the forest patches,” said Skinner. The southern bald ibis is an endemic species to southern Africa and is currently listed as globally vulnerable under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (also known as the IUCN Red List or Red Data Book). The club also hosted The Basics of Birding course in October. It included a fascinating discussion on gardening for birds and preserving the dwindling population.
Suggestions at the course were to start the birding hobby by buying field guides, like Roberts Birds of Southern Africa, Sasol Birds of Southern Africa, or Newman’s Birds of Southern Africa, to study and become familiar with birds. The golden rule is to save until you can afford good binoculars that will last, rather than investing in a cheap product that could be frustrating.
A notebook and pen, additional bird books and electronic apps, a spotting scope with a tripod, and a camera are all handy tools adding to the joy of this hobby. The Escarpment Bird Club, which is affiliated with Birdlife South Africa, has regular birding outings and an active WhatsApp group that helps people identify birds in the area.
