SEKHUKHUNE – Three men were allegedly brutally killed by a mob in Ga-Maila a Mapitsana on Monday. The alleged killings have persuaded the provincial police commissioner, Lt Gen Thembi Hadebe, to implement a 72-hour activation plan to hunt down the suspects. “Some community members of this village allegedly kidnapped four men just after midnight on Monday and accused them of stealing their livestock. They then killed three of the men, using various hard objects. The fourth victim managed to escape from the mob unhurt,” said the Limpopo SAPS spokesperson, Brig Motlafelo Mojapelo. The deceased were identified as Jikisa Phokane (50), Kwena Makwana (70) and Sedibana Makwana. “A team of investigators has already been assembled and all the relevant resources and the neighbouring police stations in the Sekhukhune District have been activated to assist in the hunt,” said Hadebe. “These acts of vigilantism and lawlessness will not be tolerated and the police will not rest until all the perpetrators are brought to book,” concluded Hadebe. Anyone with information is requested to contact Col Mahlathini Ngele on 082 573 3645 or the Crime Stop number 08600 10111. Ulternatively, use the My SAPS app or visit the nearest police station.
