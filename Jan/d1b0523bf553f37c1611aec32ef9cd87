FTLM’s mayor, Eddie Maila, indicated that despite the challenges municipal residents face, such as poverty and other socio-economic challenges, it is important to put a smile on the faces of the less fortunate.  Maila donated Christmas groceries and gifts to the orphans of Dilokong Orphanage in Driekop. The mayor was accompanied by FTLM speaker Pheladi Pholoane and Exco commiteee members. The team proceeded to Mantshatlala Disability Centre in Mphanama Village, Magagamatala Section, where they handed out Christmas groceries and other gifts. Maila said the aim of the donations was part of improving the standard of living of the orphans and those with disabilities, and also to spend a day with them to make them feel loved and appreciated. “This is part of our community programmes that are aimed at getting government closer to the people, to share a smile with the children, and to create more visibility of leadership to communities.”
