According to the head of public transport, chiefs and the community, Peer Mkhonto, the purpose of the functions was to congratulate all the stakeholders for their effort through the struggles everyone faced in 2021. He was awarded the Twin City’s Man of the Match at the first year-end function for his great achievement of bringing the mall and taxi associations together against looting and riots last year. Each tribe had their own function that was organised by the mall and they received food parcels, beverages and gifts. The tribes that shared their gratitude with the mall are the Masoyi in Phola, the Hoxani in Calcatta, the Mathibela in Oakley, the Jongilanga in Kildare, the Mdluli in Makoko, the Nkambeni in Sun River and the Kgarudi in Nkanini.

We win because the company that owns the mall, Twin City, understands that the Hazyview communities need and provide support,” said Mkhonto. Do you have more information about the story?
