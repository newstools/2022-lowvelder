The Mpumalanga Diving Unit’s Capt Pottie Potgieter stated that the victim and his companion, a witness to the incident, were taking a bath in the river just before the attack. The victim swam and got onto a rock in the middle of the river, while the witness stayed where he was. The crocodile first chased the witness, who fled to the riverbank. He was fortunately close enough to the edge to run out of the water safely. ALSO READ: Hippo takes a morning walk in Kiepersol The crocodile then turned to the other man on the rock. The victim had nowhere to flee to and could not escape the jaws of the reptile. The crocodile caught the man and dragged him off the rock into the river. According to Potgieter, the two men had been only metres apart from each other. The victim’s body was found washed up on the riverbank a few metres downstream. The diving unit recovered the body.
