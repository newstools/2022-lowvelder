SEKHUKHUNE – The Department of Transport and Community Safety has confirmed that a total of 25 taxis were impounded for operating without permits. The taxis were impounded by Limpopo traffic officials in December and January. This move has left many residents divided, as they have differing opinions on the matter. “The government knows very well that taxis are the most reliable mode of transport and they are cheaper to use. Some people cannot afford Bolt, Uber or private cabs. Besides, petrol is expensive,” said Malebo Manaka. “We acted swiftly on operators who did not comply with the law to ensure Limpopo roads are safe,” said Matome Taueatsoala, a spokesperson for the department. He said public transport operators should not put drivers and their vehicles who do not comply with the legal requirements, on the road. “Some people are complaining about this, but they are the same people who will be crying about countless accidents. We already have reckless taxi drivers that have to be dealt with, and now people want those ones who think they are above the law to be driving without permits.” Meanwhile, the minister of transport, Fikile Mbalula, confirmed on Tuesday that Limpopo had recorded a 16.5% increase in fatalities between December 1 and January 11. The province had 194 deaths during the festive season in 2020/21, and 216 people dying on Limpopo roads during this past festive season.
