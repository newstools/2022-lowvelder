Matthew Koster and Wouter de Witt (aka Ghost) have spaced out and spiced up some parts of Mbombela, and they do not plan on limiting themselves to only bus stops. Koster took it upon himself to paint the in Ferreira Street one, and with a praying mantis of all creatures. When asked why this specific being, he said it was because he was tired of the Big 5 with all the wonderful creatures and animals we have in the area. He is a freelance graphic designer and illustrator working under the alias “lazy river”. What inspired him, though, was a community project he had taken part in in Pretoria a while ago.
