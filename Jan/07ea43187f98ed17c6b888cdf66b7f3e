After 10 days of racing and one day of rest, the South African team drove themselves into the top 10 of their class. The dust has not settled for Variawa and Stassen, as the two have yet to finish the 14-day race in Saudi Arabia. The race started on January 1 and will finish tomorrow. Variawa and Stassen had to keep their focus after having completed nine stages of the Dakar Rally 2022 in Saudi Arabia in 11 days. They are competing with the all-new Toyota GR DKR Hilux T1+ for Toyota Gazoo Racing and are representing South Africa in the 4×4 petrol and diesel car class. The competitors arrived in Jeddah and drove to Ha’il to take part in the qualifying stage, stage 1A, on Saturday January 1. A short 19-kilometre special stage separated two parts of the 595-kilometre route from Jeddah to Ha’il to determine the starting order of Sunday January 2’s first real day of racing. According to the Dakar 2022 website, Variawa and Stassen came in 15th out of 88 teams in the special 19 kilometre race with a time of 12 minutes and 27 seconds, being one minute and 31 seconds behind the lead drivers. The racers were excited for the official start of the event, stage 1B, a 333-kilometre circle route from Ha’il and back, on January 2. Variawa and Stassen finished in 04:52.14 (01:21.21 behind the lead) and achieved 18th position, despite facing electrical problems that slowed them down along with a 15-minute penalty.
