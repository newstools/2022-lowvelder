Getting one requires some degree of luck and skill to achieve, so it is little wonder it often takes experience and a lot of practice. It took Daniel Pretorius, a 12-year-old of Laerskool Nelspruit, just over a year, however.  On January 5, Daniel was playing a round of golf. He lays from a 21 handicap. When reaching the fifth hole, his friend, Luan Siebrits, recommended he use a seven iron.  Daniel was a bit sceptical, as he thought he may hit over the green. He nevertheless gave it a go.

There was huge excitement, so much so that Daniel recorded the two of them on his phone approaching the hole, where they found the ball. Daniel said the excitement attracted some older members playing near them, who come over and congratulated him. By the time they finished playing and reached the clubhouse, the news had spread. Daniel received a certificate from Mbombela Golf Club, which will be framed and hung on his bedroom wall. The club has also added his name on the hole-in-one board, so that this moment will be kept alive in the history journals. Do you have more information about the story?
