Most festive soccer tournaments were completed on January 2. One tournament that attracted football
fans in and around Fetakgomo Tubatse was the Mmopane Projects Soccer Tournament. The top-32 tourney was hosted at Motodi Sports Complex. The final pitted Praktiseer United and R37 FC against each other. The two teams played an entertaining brand of football, but the Praktiseer side were clinical in front of goals as they won the match 2-0. In planning the successful tournament, the organisers confirmed they had spent more than R100 000. The
winning team, Praktiseer United, took home R20 000, a soccer kit, medals and a trophy. The runners-up, R37 FC, took home R10 000, a kit and silver medals. Some of those who were honoured included the player of the tournament, top scorers, best coach, best referees and other accolades. The sponsor and organiser, Thlomogi Mmopane, said they are organising the tournament annually. “This is the second tournament we hosted in Ga-Motodi. We aim to give back to the communities and to take the youth off the streets. We want to see the youth from our shores playing in the elite leagues.” Mmopane confirmed that the tournament would be held annually.
