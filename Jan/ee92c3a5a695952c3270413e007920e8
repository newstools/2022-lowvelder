BURGERSFORT – Cases of Tubatse minors being raped are on the increase. Another man has appeared in the Praktiseer Magistrate’s Court for allegedly raping a minor. The accused, Sipho Mokwena (52) of Kgautšwana, appeared in court on December 30. It is alleged that on December 18, the child was playing in the street with some other children when Mokwena lured her to his
house and raped her. “After the ordeal, Mokwena released the child and gave her R2 to buy some snacks,” said the Limpopo NPA’s spokesperson, Mashudu Malabi Dzhangi. “A neighbour saw the child coming out of Mokwena’s house and asked the child why she was not walking well. The neighbour alerted the mother and the child was taken to the clinic the following day. Later it was confirmed that she had been raped, and Mokwena was arrested by the police.” The case has been postponed to January 30 for further investigations and a formal bail application.
