Elated young faces were seen at Riverside Mall on Saturday, and will likely be seen well into next month. The Mbombela Tour of Tommy’s World Fair 2022 Roadshow has anchored itself here and will offer various rides until February 13. Luckily, seeing as the fair is located right outside the mall’s main entrance, there is a quick solution to staying dry when rain starts pouring down – as was the case on Saturday. One moment there were screams coming from those brave enough to risk a ride, and the next the children and their mothers were running for cover as the rain came. Patiently, though, they waited out the bad weather and took up the fun again as soon as it had cleared. During the week, the fair can be visited from 14:00 until 20:00 and on weekends the fun starts at 12:00 and runs until 21:00. Entrance is free, while a ticket for a ride is R40.
