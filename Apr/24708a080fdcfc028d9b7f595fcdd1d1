BURGERSFORT – The local community and friends of Mmathapelo Glad Malatji (17) are excited by the girl’s recent achievements. The grade 12 learner of Calvin College recently won the best advocacy queen of mental health 2022 at the Musgrave Hotelbin Durban. This was not Mmathapelo’s only achievement since the start of 2022. She also recently won Miss Teen Universe South Africa and Limpopo Provincial Queen 2022.

I spend my time writing and researching more about my advocacy, which is mental health awareness.” According to the determined girl, there are so many pageants lined up for her this year. “I will also participate in the Miss Teen International South Africa title on July 15 and 16. The winner for this competition will represent SA in Ecuador, South America,” said the determined girl.
