Lowvelders flocked to the magical Sudwala Caves for a spellbinding performance by musician Elvis Blue, accompanied by the choirs of Hoërskool Nelspruit and Laerskool Nelspruit, on Saturday April 9. The show was organised as part of a local charity fundraiser for Moving Mountains that works with and supports cancer patients.  It was nearly a full house, despite the rainy and cold weather.

Garnering a resounding round of applause, next to perform was the Hoërskool Nelspruit choir.  Their voices filled the caves, while the audience sat in awe, until Elvis Blue entered the stage and a rapturous applause was all that could be heard.

He thanked everyone who came out to watch the show and support Moving Mountains, and said it was a privilege and honour for him to be able to sing inside the caves as well as to sing with the Hoërskool Nelspruit choir. Once Elvis Blue’s performance had finished, the crowd could be heard gushing over the show. Not only were they enamoured with him; both the choirs gave impressive performances that moved some audience members to tears.
