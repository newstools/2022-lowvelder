The parish consists of the St John’s church on the corner of Kerk and Burger streets in Lydenburg and the St Paul’s congregation of Mashishing. The Anglican Parish of Mashishing will be celebrating its 155th anniversary in June. In the 1860s, despite only having a small population, Lydenburg became the provincial centre for the goldfields, as many people travelled via the town on the hazardous journey through malaria and sleeping sickness rife country to reach Pilgrims Rest.
The St John’s Parish was established with Rev John Thorne the first resident priest.
In 1874, the building of the present church commenced. The church bell was made in England in 1884, and transported from Durban to Lydenburg by ox-wagon. It arrived in 1887 and has the words: “When I do call, come serve God all” engraved on it.
In 1886, Rev Alfred Roberts started work at an English school on the church grounds.
In 1925, a hostel for boys and girls was built, but it was demolished in 1970 due to a lack of funds and resulting deterioration. During the Anglo-Boer War, the church served as a garrison church for troops quartered in and around town.
In the church, mural tablets commemorate the men of the Manchester Regiment who were killed during the war, and another honours the Lydenburg Volunteers who died during the Sekhukhune Wars of 1876. In August 2000, St John’s became part of the independent parish of Mashishing, which includes St John’s and St Paul’s congregations.
The church is planning a celebration for later this year.
