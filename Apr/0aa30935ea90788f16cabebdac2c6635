After hearing that she was nominated as one of the 34 finalists in June 2021, Monique O’Reilly made the most out of every moment she faced in the 2021/22 Mrs Mpumalanga. To take part in Mrs Mpumalanga, O’Reilly had to raise money, sell advertisements for a competition, as a certain amount of ticket sales was required to enter the pageant, organise opportunities to do charity work and show what impact she has on the community.  “I’ve learned that it’s so worth it to get out of your comfort zone, to find yourself as a person and really live out your life, which could be doing your own thing or helping another, because what you do for yourself and others are really worth it. Sometimes we all just need that change of direction to really live out who we are,” said O’Reilly.

You do not have to be pretty or skinny or perfect, because it’s about you as a person and what you want to achieve with your projects and goals in life. This is a platform given to you to convey to everyone what you believe and what you want to achieve,” she said. ALSO READ: Lanies have Chicken Licken Golf Day
