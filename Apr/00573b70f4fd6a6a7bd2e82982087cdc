The pop-up park was hosted by Juan de Beer, Jacques Smith, Amber Shepstone and Jan Viljoen of the rescue unit, and the team’s passion for snakes were shared with the children who were fascinated by the reptiles.

Our goal with the park was to educate the children on snakes by interacting with the reptiles themselves,” said De Beer. The rescue unit will set up another pop-up park this Easter weekend, from April 15 to 17.
