It is a complete shutdown of services in Sabie as protesters have blockaded the entrances to town, demanding better service delivery from Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM). On Monday April 25, protesters blocked the intersections from Hazyview to Sabie and from Graskop to Sabie. Stores, schools, lodges, banks and all the other service delivery buildings were closed.  They used stones, branches, road signs and refuse. Some protesters instructed motorists to turn away. According to the protesters, they are tired of TCLM’s poor service and corruption. They said they want job opportunities and demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa should come and address the situation. A protester, who wished to remain anonymous, said they chose to address the matter by demonstrating on the roads so that their matter would get the attention it deserves.

They do not take us seriously and have not done so for so many years, and it has to end at some point. The municipality serves a few individuals, especially here in Sabie. The situation is better in Mashishing. “After the recent elections, African Unified Movement won some wards, and this has resulted in some officials undermining meetings. We want the acting unit manager to step down, because he has never done anything for us. He has been acting for four years and the contract states he should have acted for three months. This is not the only issue; the acting municipal manager of TCLM must also step down.”  Do you have more information about the story? Please send us an email to editorial@lowvelder.co.za.
