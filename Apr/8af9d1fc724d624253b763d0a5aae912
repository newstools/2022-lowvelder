An eight-tonne truck filled with clothes, food and water donated by scores of Lowvelders left for KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday April 23 as part of the Nelspruit for KZN project. Coordinated by the Lions Club’s Koos Schoonraad, the relief outreach garnered support from various schools, businesses and individuals across the community, all ready to help those affected by the floods in KwaZulu-Natal. Schoonraad said that local business 2Care4Water donated 5 000 litres of water. Thousands of items of clothing, from T-shirts to winter jackets, as well as blankets and foodstuffs were also donated.
