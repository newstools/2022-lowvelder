Nkomazi Local Municipality’s (NLM) executive mayor, Johan Mkhatshwa’s days at the helm of this troubled municipality are numbered. The newly elected provincial executive committee of the Mpumalanga ANC said it would not tolerate ill discipline among its members. During a press conference last Wednesday, the party secretary, Muzi Chirwa, said all the leadership problems in troublesome municipalities would be fixed and the positions that were “hijacked” would be reclaimed. Following the November 1, 2021, local government elections, the ANC’s national executive committee had chosen Phindile Magagula as its preferred candidate to take over the reigns as the new executive mayor for this municipality. However, Mkhatshwa accepted the nomination for a second term on November 23, despite the ANC preferring Magagula.

Following these actions, the provincial ANC instituted disciplinary action against its councillors who had voted with the opposition. Both Mkhatshwa and Mashele were found guilty and were expelled from the organisation, along with four other councillors also found guilty in this matter. Their recent court bid to have them reinstated into their positions was dismissed. “We are going to fix the problems in these municipalities and restore order,” vowed Chirwa.
