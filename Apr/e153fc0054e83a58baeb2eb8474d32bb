Drivers are being warned not to use the N4 between Malalane and Komatipoort during nighttime, as the number of road spikes and various purpose-specific objects to slow down vehicles have increased. Reports have been confirmed of an incident that had occurred between Hectorspruit and the Coopersdal Junction on Monday April 11 at 23:00, where a taxi bound to Mozambique was spiked, which led to passengers being robbed and the taxi driver being hacked to death.

Two passengers are still reported missing by Komatipoort police and are being searched for in the area where the taxi was stopped, and on farms next to the N4. “It is clear that there are multiple organised groups active along the N4 in the affected area. They operate at night. It is therefore highly dangerous to travel the N4 between Malalane and Komatipoort after dark. Avoid it if possible,” said Alwin Carstens of Nkomazi Security Solutions.

Not all targeted road users have reported the crimes, but decided instead to share them on social media. Spiking incidents have occurred as far as Impala Station, about seven kilometres east of Malalane, but successful robberies have been centred around Hectorspruit. The stretch of road affected is almost 50 kilometres in length, which makes patrolling a challenge.
