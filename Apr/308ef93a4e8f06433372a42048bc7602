Two elephants, Kasper and Kitso, died while under sedation during relocation efforts from the Lowveld to Kleinmond Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS) in the Western Cape on April 23. According to the owner and custodian of the elephants, Craig Saunders, they had been in the care of Elephant Sanctuary, Hazyview for the past 20 years.

It was his vision to relocate two adult bull elephants from Hazyview to Kleinmond, as their existing habitat in Hazyview had fallen under increasing social and environmental pressure. He invested years into careful planning with a key focus on clearing alien species and restoring the property to its original pristine condition, hence the creation of KWS.
