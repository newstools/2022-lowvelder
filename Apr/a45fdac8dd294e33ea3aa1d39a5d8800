Residents of the old Transnet station have been without electricity since mid-November due to cable theft. The locals, who want to remain anonymous, said their landlord, Transnet, has refused to replace the stolen cables, because one of the houses owes it R100 000. “We pay R5 000 a month. Before they stole the cables, we were all paying for electricity, so we don’t know which house they are referring to. The painful part about this situation is that there are seven families in seven houses, of which two houses are occupied by pensioners and another house has six tenants – three are still in preschool and one is a pensioner.” ALSO READ: Another tourist attack on the Numbi road The resident also said criminals had broken into one property where an old couple lived and stole quite a lot of things. It is starting to become really dangerous and most of the residents cannot afford other places to stay. “Since the power has been cut, we now depend on gas to cook and candles for light. We have to fetch water in town since our borehole is also not working. The situation poses a danger to our lives since criminals take advantage of the darkness to rob us. Our kids now use candles at night to do their homework. We appeal to the government to intervene,” they said.
