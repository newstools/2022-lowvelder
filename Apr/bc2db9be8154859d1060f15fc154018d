This was the first event the Lydenburg Mashishing Business Chamber (LMBC) held after a long two years of restrictions due to Covid-19. De Ark Guest House served a wonderful breakfast as the networking continued. Pr TJ Maré representing Kruger Lowvelder Chamber of Business and Tourism (KLCBT) in Mbombela, was the guest speaker. He was speaking about the success the chamber is reaching in the city  “We have found it is instrumental that every business and resident gets involved, even if it is picking up a piece of paper or buying a rake for the cleaning crew. We always thought we should sit back and wait for the government and municipalities to sort out day-to-day problems, but there are areas that chambers can get involved with and make a difference.” He also said he is proud of what the Lydenburg chamber is achieving, and that he can see that its members are making a difference. André Hanekom, a LMBC administrator, echoed this when he gave a detailed presentation about the chamber’s projects since the year commenced. LMBC also thanked the businesses that have helped to cut the grass, sponsor working teams and donate money for the different projects. The difference can be seen as residents drive through the streets of Lydenburg. The current project is fixing the four-way stop at Mashishing and Kellysville, headed by Bruce James. Another big project was scraping the road toward the landfill site and cutting overhanging brushes on the sidewalks.  Steelburger/Lydenburg News will do an in-depth article and publish more photos of this successful event in the print edition next week.
