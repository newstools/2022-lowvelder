Using relevant photographs, he, as a representative of Birdlife SA, introduced the beauty of birding to 80 attendees at the Marloth Park Honorary Rangers fundraising event. The interest of birding brings tourists to birding-rich environments like the Lowveld’s Kruger Park and Marloth Park. “It was one of our monthly educational fundraisers. We are an organisation of volunteers and must raise all our own funding for our conservation-related projects, such as alien clearing, veld rehabilitation and our restore our veld by-law campaign that aims to get property owners to know and understand the conservation-related by-laws of Marloth Park,” said Judy Norton from the fundraising team.
