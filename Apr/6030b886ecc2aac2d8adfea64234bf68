Two field rangers have been arrested on charges related to fraud, money laundering and corruption. This follows an extensive investigation led by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (Hawks), with support from the Skukuza Stock Theft and Endangered Species Unit. In a statement by South African National Parks (SANParks) on Saturday, it said the arrests form part of an ongoing external investigation and no further details are available at this time.

When employees are exposed it has far reaching consequences for themselves, their families and their own communities,” he said. “Only through discipline, honesty and teamwork, combined with the desire to serve the people of our country selflessly, will we be able to stem the tide of rhino poaching in KNP” Coleman said.
