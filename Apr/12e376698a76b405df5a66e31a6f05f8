A German tourist and his son experienced quite the unusual sighting in the Kruger National Park over the Easter weekend. An injured waterbuck was faced with what seemed like certain death when wild dogs approached it. Hanno Erlmann first explained the scene on the Latest Sightings website, saying that had it left him stunned. “The wild dogs harassed the buck for about five minutes, and then just… left.” ALSO READ: Two elephants die while under sedation Later on a hyena also appeared, but ignored the buck. Erlmann said he had seen a few hunt attempts during his time in the Kruger, but this one was just strange, “… like aliens coming to Earth, having a look, and leaving without comment.” When speaking to Lowvelder, Erlmann added that his seven-year-old son, Phoenix, was just as ready with his camera as he had been. “Phoenix uses an adult camera himself. He is mainly into birds and shot about 1 900 pics during the two-week trip.” He managed some pictures and videos of this particular sighting, as well. “His reaction was pure excitement. He is not squeamish, so the impending blood did not bother him – he is very aware of how nature works,” said Hanno.  This 12-day trip was the first of many more planned for the father and son, but in the meantime, they are back home in Germany.
