JANE FURSE – A 41-year-old Sekhukhune mother’s conjoined twins have passed away. The babies were born at Jane Furse Hospital on April 7 and were admitted to Mankweng Tertiary & Academic Hospital’s Neonatal ICU. The twins deteriorated overnight and died early this morning, April 14. Since their admission to Mankweng’s Neonatal ICU, specialists from various clinical disciplines from both Mankweng-Pietersburg Complex and Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital, have been hard at work in pursuit of the best possible intervention for the case. The initial set of studies revealed multiple complexities that required appropriate and thorough planning of further management. “We were hopeful that the scheduled joint academic meeting between specialists from Mankweng Tertiary Academic and Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital would bring the desired results for the future of the twins. Unfortunately they did not make it. Our sincere condolences go out to the family and community at large,” said the Limpopo MEC for health, Dr Phophi Ramathuba.
