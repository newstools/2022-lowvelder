The campaign was held over two Saturdays, the one on April 9 and the other on April 23. Indlovu SPAR and Lowveld Mall collaborated to provide the loyal communities of Hazyview the opportunity to receive something back. If shoppers spent R100 in any shop at the mall, they qualified for a bag of rice.  On April 9, a total of 600 bags were handed out to customers and another 600 on
April 23. “We always work on ideas like this one to say thank you to our shoppers who support the mall. We show our loyalty to the customers in Hazyview with whom we have built relationships over the years, and we are far from done showing our appreciation to each and every supporter,” said Lowveld Mall’s marketing manager, Tania Manjate.
