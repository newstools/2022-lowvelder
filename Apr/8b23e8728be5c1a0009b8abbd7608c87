Based on chapter 7 of Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, the concept of such a tea party is nothing new. The Sabie Care Buddies, however, brought Alice’s whole wonderful world right up to date on April 8 when they organised and presented a Mad Hatter’s tea party at the Sabie Retirement Village, all under the watchful eyes of John and Pinkie Calmeyer, whose immaculately maintained hall and spotless and well-equipped kitchen were made available to the Care Buddies at no cost. Whoever thought of such a project must also be slightly mad in the head, as the amount of work the Care Buddies had put in to bring the whole notion to fruition was staggering.

Proceedings were kicked off by the master of ceremonies, John Calmeyer, who gave a detailed and most interesting insight into the life and times of Alice in Wonderland, both factual and fictional! The room was soon full of senior citizens adorned in the most eye-catching hats in all shapes, sizes and colours. Once prizes had been handed out, the party officially began. The guests tucked into the mouth-watering array of savoury and sweet snacks, washed down by an endless supply of Care Buddies home-made punch. Do you have more information about the story?
