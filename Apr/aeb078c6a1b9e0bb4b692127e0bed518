The Our Mbombela movement is canvassing local businesses and organisations to join it in sweeping up the city. More and more community members are joining the campaign every week. The movement was launched earlier this year with the aim to restore and maintain city spaces to keep it and its people safe from crime. Since the launch, many local businesses and organisations as well as community groups have picked up their tools, donated cleaning tools and equipment, and got to work on restoring Mbombela.

The parks are opposite Village SPAR, near Westpack, in Wilger Street and near Lowvelder. Pr TJ Maré of We Care 4 Nelspruit said they are concentrating on the four main parks at the main entrances into Mbombela and are removing fallen trees, cutting grass, and picking up rubbish to beautify the areas and make them safe. Lowvelder will be sponsoring the installation of a camera at the park outside the property as well. “We have many businesses getting involved and it is very exciting,” said Maré. “We are encouraging people to support the movement and help in any way they can.” People can get involved by donating fuel or money for fuel for the grass-cutting equipment as the park cleaning team uses around 30 litres of petrol a day. Food or money for food for the workers as well as stipends for their work for the day can also be donated. Visit the Our Mbombela Facebook page to learn more about becoming part of the movement.
