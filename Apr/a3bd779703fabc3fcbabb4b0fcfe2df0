It combines speed, strength and technical ability, as participants hustle to overcome obstacles during either the five-kilometre (rookie with 15 obstacles), 10-kilometre (commando with 22 obstacles) or 15-kilometre (black ops with 32 obstacles) categories. Some locals competed as part of the Obstacle Course Racing (OCR) Nelspruit Eagles Club. The team consisted of Alicia Bullen, Pieter Briel, Ashley Betteridge, Anthony Jenkinson, Braam Labuschagne, Reynard de Bruin, Andrew Martin, Stacey Gerber and Lize-Marie Dreyer. These elite athletes performed well and won two podium positions. Martin won the commando elite category and Bullen won overall first female in the rookie elite category.
