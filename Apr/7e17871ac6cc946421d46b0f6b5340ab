MBOMBELA – Constant electricity problems are caused by the Delta Substation network and the Enos Mabuza/Johanna Street roadworks. These two issues of major concern and frustration for the residents of wards 15, 16 and 17 will be brought to the table during an emergency meeting with City management. “Due to the constant power disruptions and clear failure (of the council) in terms of the electricity infrastructure in and around the City’s central wards, I have been requested by the residents and business stakeholders to facilitate a public meeting. “This is to discuss the challenge and obtain answers from the municipality on the reasons why this problem has not been addressed,” Cllr Sanley van der Merwe said in a letter to the City’s speaker, Cllr Mduduzi Nkhata.

Another frustration for motorists is Enos Mabuza Drive. “This road upgrade project has been dragging on for months now, and every time the council makes promises of a new completion date that is never met.” The road project was awarded to White Hazy Building Construction from Hazyview in 2020. Originally it should have been completed in 18 months. Van der Merwe requested that the mayor, Cllr Sibongile Makhushe, the municipal manager, Wiseman Khumalo, and the members of the mayoral committee for energy as well as public works should attend the meeting, held in the municipal council chambers on April 20 at 18:00. “We would like to encourage residents to make use of this golden opportunity to face the responsible decision makers and get first-hand information about these frustrations,” Van der Merwe said.
