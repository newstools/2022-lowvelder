It has been six months since a water leak at the Nelspruit SPCA was first reported to Silulumanzi. According to the Nelspruit SPCA’s chairperson, Lize Pienaar, the problem started out as a small leak, but has now become a trench-sized hole. “We have a million Silulumanzi reference numbers as proof that this problem was reported. Due to this ongoing leak, our building structure is now starting to deteriorate,” she said.

The response the organisation received from the water supplier was that the soil at the site was still wet, and therefore, they could not fix the leak. Silulumanzi said matters stand now, it cannot acquire dry soil to refill the open trench. Pienaar said they are appealing to members of the public for help, as the SPCA does not have the funds to repair this problem or to pay for water going to waste. “Silulumanzi must take financial responsibility for the structural damage to our centre. The leak is causing wear and tear to our structures and will cost a lot of money to fix. At the moment, we cannot let the dogs out to play, because they will drown. It is a welfare concern as the animals cannot receive proper exercise and playtime,” she said.

It was, however, found that the leaking pipe, which is made of steel and is at least 40 years old, has corroded to such an extent that the leaks can no longer be repaired effectively. “A significant section of this pipe has to be removed and replaced with a new one, at considerable expense. We are in the process of obtaining quotations for the pipe replacement and envisage that work will commence early in May,” he said.
