Dr Enos Mabuza Drive is expected to have all lanes at the intersection of Madiba Drive functional in the next two weeks. Work on one of the lanes had been slightly delayed as sensitive cables needed to be removed from under the road in order for work on that lane to continue. Two of the three sensitive cables were moved around two weeks ago while the third one was removed on Friday, March 25. White Hazy Construction’s Japie Visser said now the cables had been moved, work on the road would progress quickly.

Visser said once the road was finished there would still be a bit more work to be done on railings and paving, but the road would be ready for use without any more blockages.
