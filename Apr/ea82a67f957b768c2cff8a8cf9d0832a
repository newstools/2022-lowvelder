For 38 years, Malelane Golf Club has been dedicated to hosting one of the Lowveld’s best annual golf tournaments, the Lalapalm. This four-day golfing tournament has proven to be one of the Lowveld’s main drawcards time and time again.  The tournament attracted amateur players from all over South Africa. The golf committee sprang into action with all the preparation needed to make this four-day event a success.  An exceptional job was done out on the course, as getting it into top shape and fit for players to enjoy was a priority. The field was filled to capacity and consisted of two playing fields, a morning and an afternoon field, where roughly 98 players were on the course every day.
