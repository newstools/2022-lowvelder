STEELPOORT – The seven-year-old Ndaloenhle Lethabo Sibanyoni has always enjoyed modelling. Since the age of three, the young girl has been parading on the veranda, imitating top models. It does not come by surprise that she will represent South Africa in the Little Mr. and Miss Africa. The pageants will be held in Uganda at the Pearl of Africa Hotel on April 15. Ndaloenhle said modelling has taught her to love and respect herself and other people around her. “Modelling taught me to be able to share, forgive and be confident in myself and what I can achieve.” She knows how to handle tricky interview questions and the pressure that comes with them. This is all thanks to the modelling lessons she has taken at the Sekhukhune Pageantry and Modelling Academy. The grade two pupil at Steelpoort Academy has won many crowns, including Miss Valentine at Tingeling School when she was four years old. Other accolades include Miss Spring Tiny Tots, Miss United Limpopo, and she was also in the top five of Miss Mafate. On April 2 she is scheduled to compete in the Miss Elegance Johannesburg. Her mother, Poppy, said she is doing her best to make sure that her daughter’s dream of representing South Africa in Uganda become a reality. “As a former model, I want her to achieve more than I did. She was born into a modelling family and drew inspiration from her mother.” The former model believes Ndaloenhle can bring the crown home and pleads for assistance from locals businesses, government departments and Good Samaritans. She and the girl’s mentor and coach, Pearl Ngele, ask for donations to cover the trip to East Africa. The two can be reached on 078 736 7760 or on Instagram @ndaloenhlesibanyoni.
