The morning’s speaker was Charmaine de Graeve of the Step Foundation and Jethro Group, part of the Red My Lips campaign. This is a national campaign to support these survivors. The ladies who attended wore their most bright red lipstick for the occasion. Heidi Betz, reigning Mrs Universe SA first princess, organised this morning at Café Crust and also invited some female members of the Lydenburg SAPS as they are familiar with domestic and sexual abuse cases.
“When I started my journey to the Mrs Universe SA stage, I wanted to help make a difference in people’s lives. I asked the Lord to use me,” said Betz. De Grave is usually the first person a victim calls in a time of crisis. “I gave the women practical advice on what to do when they were raped or sexually abused. It is important for them to take the clothes
they are wearing and put them in a bag for evidence, visit a hospital to have a J88
(a rape kit) done, and always keep a urine sample. This first sample taken after the assault is very important,” said De Graeve. She can be contacted on 073 066 8836. She stresses that callers will remain anonymous and she will help women and children to be relocated to safe houses if necessary.
Betz thanked André du Preez of Crust Café for sponsoring the food and venue, Maliflora, Rietfontein Packaging, Guest and Glasses, Jethro Group and the Step Foundation.
