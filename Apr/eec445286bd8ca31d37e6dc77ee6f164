One of the Wendy houses had burned down in November. “An anonymous donor made the funds available for the new Wendy to be built by Wendy Lane, Mbombela,” said Venter. Venter was elected as a councillor of the FF Plus in November, and she uses her new political platform to put even more emphasis on the plight of the needy and homeless in the greater Lydenburg area. “We thank the Lord for such a blessing. We are currently busy with a Go Fund Me housing project to replace old Wendy houses with new ones in favour of Soli Deo Gloria. In the same breath, I want to thank everyone that keeps Soli in their prayers, and for the continued donations,” said Venter. They hope this upgrade will make it possible to add space for at least 50 more, with the help of more donations and support from the community.”
