Between April 3 and 11, Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary received two more orphaned rhino calves. A SANParks helicopter landed at Care for Wild with the first calf, about two months old, on April 3. The sanctuary said, “His mother had been brutally killed by poachers. Terrified, alone and defenceless, this little calf did not know what to do. He lay by his mother’s body, but was then attacked by hyenas, and part of his tail was bitten off. “Fortunately, he was found just in time before he starved to death or was killed by predators. Section ranger Rob Thompson, SANParks veterinarian Dr Lufunu Netshithavadulu and pilot Brad Grafton flew the calf here.” ALSO READ: Another historic birth at Care for Wild Although he remains in ICU, he is progressing well, said the sanctuary. He was taken outside last week, but remained close to his caregiver.  “He is only a few months old and his vulnerability and need for his mum is clear. “It will be important for him to meet the other rhinos soon so that he can form emotional bonds and connections with his own species, but for now he needs a lot of care and his wounds need treatment.” The newest addition to the Care for Wild family is a female aged between 18 and 20 months. She arrived on April 11. ALSO READ: Yet another rhino calf admitted to Care for Wild The sanctuary said she was first spotted alone more than a week ago, but had evaded the rescue mission. She was spotted again on the borders of the Kruger National Park and flown by SANParks directly to the Kruger bomas. Care for Wild collected the calf and she has arrived safely at the sanctuary. The sanctuary thanked all the parties involved. Do you have more information about the story? Please send us an email to editorial@lowvelder.co.za.
