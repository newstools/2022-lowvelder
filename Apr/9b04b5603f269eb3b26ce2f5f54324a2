The spokesperson of the Mpofu family, Connie Mpofu, said the ordeal started when a traditional healer wanted to hire one of the Mpofus’ taxis to get to Acornhoek over March 24 and March 25. “On Friday the driver of the taxi called while on his way to Acornhoek and said the traditional healer had requested staying until the Sunday, and my mom agreed,” said Mpofu. “It was around 01:00 on Saturday when the driver’s sister came to my mother and said he had been hijacked. We called the driver and he said two women who were traditional healers had asked him to drive them somewhere during the night.” ALSO READ: Limpopo’s conjoined twins pass away “The taxi was supposed to be parked in the yard of the traditional healer. It seems he took the taxi, together with some of the traditional healers’ assistants, to a tavern and forgot to take the keys from the vehicle. When he went back the taxi was nowhere to be found and he then faked a hijacking. “We phoned the tracking company and police. Fortunately the sergeant recovered the taxi. An amp was stolen and the taxi ran out of petrol. “The sergeant recovered it in near perfect condition. He acted quickly and and kept us in the loop to what was going on. He also called us the next day, on Sunday, to check if everything was okay. He made us feel like we really mattered, like we were a priority, and we are very grateful to him,” she said. No case has been opened as the taxi was recovered. Ngobeni said he went out on Manyeleti Road in Acornhoek where he found the driver drunk next to Edward Tavern. He said the taxi was recovered at around 03:20 that morning. “I have been in the police service for 16 years,” said Ngobeni. “I feel privileged to be chosen as it is rare for community members to appreciate good work done by police members. I encourage my colleagues to work hard and go the extra mile to assist the community to the best of their ability,” he said. ALSO READ: Lebombo Border Post to now operate 24/7
