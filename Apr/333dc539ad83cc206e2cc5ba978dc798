A 41-year-old mother has delivered a set of conjoined babies in the Jane Furse Hospital on Thursday April 7. The babies were delivered through a caesarean section. The patient was referred from a local clinic earlier this week and the prenatal examinations had not assess that the twins were conjoined. The doctors only discovered that during the delivery. The babies were transferred to Mankweng Hospital for a full and further assessment by both neonatologists and paediatric surgeons.
