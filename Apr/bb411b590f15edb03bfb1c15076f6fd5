The development of the estate started in 2014 and has since enjoyed two sold-out phases: Likweti Hills (Phase 1) and Likweti Plains (Phase 2). Likweti Views, so named for its magnificent and truly breathtaking views from every angle, was launched in 2021 and is the third phase of this sought-after development. One-hectare stands at Likweti Views are now selling from R1.1m. Construction of the second developer house at Likweti Views is set to start in May. This four-bedroom contemporary family home will feature bespoke architectural details inspired by the natural surroundings and high-end finishes throughout the house. Expansive open-plan and elegant living rooms leading out onto an exceptional covered patio with a built-in braai, make this an entertainer’s dream home.  • Stand size: 1ha
• Total covered area: 413m²
• Four bedrooms
• En-suite bathrooms
• Open-plan living, dining and kitchen
• Separate scullery and pantry
• Covered patio with braai

• Double garage. The four generous bedrooms all have en-suite bathrooms, and the master en suite includes both an indoor and a stunning outdoor shower. Three of the four bedrooms open out onto private sun decks to take in the views.  The house will face south-east with lovely views of the Komatipoort Gorge. A north-facing garden patio with equally beautiful views of the Lowveld will be the perfect spot to bask in the winter sun.  The one-hectare stand has an elevated position, providing sweeping views all round. Every room in this single-storey home will be a room with a view. One of the en-suite bedrooms can be converted into a study with a separate guest bathroom. The design and layout can be tailored to an individual client’s taste and requirements if the building has not progressed beyond a certain stage. The client’s choices of fixtures and/or fittings can be accommodated, based on the current budget allowance.
