The Committee of Limpopo Schools Athletics has recently announced a strong team comprising more than 100 athletes who represented the province during the South African Schools Athletics (SASA) Championships. The SASA competition for the primary schools was organised at Kenneth McArthur Athletics Stadium in Potchefstroom from March 25 to 26. Among the athletes was Tubatse’s own Temosho Morena (12). Temosho is from Laerskool Laersdrift Roossenekal. The boy was third in the u/13 100-metre race. For his efforts, he received a certificate and a medal. “I feel very proud to have represented my province in the national championships. I will continue training hard to perfect my talent and will fight to represent Limpopo in the 2023 competitions,” said the determined Temosho. He thanked his family, friends, the education department and his school for the support bestowed on him. Peter Maluleke, the secretary of Limpopo Schools Athletics, said the athletes participated in field and track events. He said that they did the province proud as they brought medals home. “Indeed, Limpopo has talent. The likes of Temosho are the future stars of this country,” Maluleke concluded.
