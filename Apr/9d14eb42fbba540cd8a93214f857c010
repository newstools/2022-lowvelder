“We have tried our best to make a difference and to start improving our town, but we rely on cash contributions and donations. We currently have no funds to continue. If residents could commit to contributing R200 per month and businesses R500 per month for the next 12 months, it would make such a huge difference. There was great support after the business breakfast on April 7, and we also want to thank all the businesses that support the event,” said Etli van der Merwe, LMBC chairperson. The donations and debit orders for monthly support for the cleaning and maintenance can be paid directly into the LMBC savings account:
