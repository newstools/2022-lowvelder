Even though cabaret is not Greek in its origin, that did not stop The Greek Kouzina from staging this performance on Saturday evening. The owner of the restaurant, Deon Dennis, said it was something different and they wanted to bring some life into the city with it. Two well-know local singers, Bianca and Lonita Swift, were the stars of the show. They explained that they made the evening a mixture of cabaret and musical numbers taking inspiration from a variety of movies.

The two took turns with solos as well as a few duets.  Bianca’s favourite for the evening was “Never Enough” from The Greatest Showman, whereas Lonita’s heart was stolen by “Never Love Again” from A Star is Born. They both agreed on a favourite duet as well: “A Million Dreams”, also from The Greatest Showman. Naturally, as with all of The Greek’s themed evenings, the night would not be complete without the zorba, which includes dancing and some plate breaking. Do you have more information about the story?
