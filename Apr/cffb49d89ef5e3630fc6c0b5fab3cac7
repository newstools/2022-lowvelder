Local musician and guitarist extraordinaire, Jonathan Peyper, wowed Die Windpomp with an electrifying rock and blues performance on Friday evening. Born and raised in Mbombela, Peyper said he had not performed in the Lowveld for quite a while and said it was good to be getting back to his roots by having a show at Die Windpomp. “It is lekker to be back,” said Peyper before he took to the stage. “Covid was a big knock to everyone, especially musicians, so the love and support shown this evening has been amazing,” said Peyper.
