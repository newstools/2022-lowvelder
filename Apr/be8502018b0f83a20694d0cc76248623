It was an opportunity for the youngsters to experience the fun of school sport for the first time since the pandemic. The schools that participated in the Pumaki Tag Rugby and Mini Netball Day were Curro, Nelspruit Primary, White River, Lydenburg, Komatipoort, Malelane, Barberton, Sabie, Graskop and Numbi. The schools’ u/7s and u/8s played two games, but no score from any game was kept, as the goal of the event was for the children to enjoy the introduction of rugby and netball.

The netball courts and rugby fields were packed with parents supporting their young ones throughout the day. “Numbi Primary School’s u/7 and u/8 teams definitely had the upper hand and did their job so well. Our school can be very proud of its youngest teams. It was so nice to be able to stand next to a field and see how they enjoy it, because sport is a big part of our society and keeps our children positive,” said the u/7 rugby coach, Edwil Rabe.
