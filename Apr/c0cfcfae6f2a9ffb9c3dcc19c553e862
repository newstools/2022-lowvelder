But time was against them. I had to use the snake catcher stick to hook the baby’s leg and pull her out of the pit. She was washed and rushed to the hospital. Mom and baby are both reported to be in good condition,” he said.

The mother’s aunt, Lindi Malandule, confirmed that her niece had been pregnant with her third child. “When the incident happened, she had been alone at home, but she managed to seek help from her neighbours, who alerted me. But when I arrived, the baby was already out of the pit. I assisted in washing her and accompanied them to hospital. The doctors said they would monitor them for a few days before discharging them,” Malandule said.
