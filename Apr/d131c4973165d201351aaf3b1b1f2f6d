This traffic flow commitment that the border management authority recently announced, has been acknowledged as Komatipoort’s “miracle move”. The Komatipoort Business Chamber (KBC) realised mid-June 2021 that a proper discussion involving the border management authority, TRAC and representatives from the trucking industry, was critical to address the crisis. The CEO of Coalescence Consulting and interim Maputo Corridor spokesperson, Barbara Mommen, who is well versed with the impact of the border frustrations over decades, delivered her opinion on the matter, which was well received by the state departments and the industry. According to Mommen, the Maputo Corridor services between 1 300 and 1 400 trucks on a daily basis, and with approximately 60% of these vehicles servicing transit cargo to the Port of Maputo, the opening of the border 24/7 will ensure greater efficiencies, a reduction in vehicle turnaround times, and a shot in the arm for the competitiveness of the Maputo Corridor in international trade.
