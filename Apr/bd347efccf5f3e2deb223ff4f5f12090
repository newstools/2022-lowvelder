BURGERSFORT – The Driekop SAPS is on a manhunt for the suspect who brutally killed a woman and injured her four-year-old child last month. The woman’s body was found in the bush near Mamphahlane Village on March 26. “On that day, the police received a call from a community member about a child who was running in the street, bleeding with open wounds on his face. They reacted swiftly and rushed to the scene. Upon their arrival, the child informed them that his mother had been injured and was in the nearby bush. A search for the woman ensued. She was found lying on the ground with multiple stab wounds all over her body,” said the Limpopo SAPS spokesperson, Brig Motlafelo Mojapelo. He said members of the Emergency Medical Services were summoned and the woman was certified dead on the scene. The child was admitted to a local hospital for treatment. “The deceased has not yet been identified. She is a young woman who might be in her 30s and was wearing a blue jean skirt and a white T-shirt with black tiger print. The child is still being treated in hospital and is
unable to shed any light in this regard,” said Mojapelo. According to the SAPS, the motive behind the incident is currently unknown, but domestic or gender-based violence cannot be ruled out. “The brutal nature of this incident requires that the suspect be brought to book as speedily as possible. I therefore
call upon the members of the community to assist the police in the investigations,” said the provincial police commissioner, Lt Gen Thembi Hadebe. Cases of murder and attempted murder have been opened, and anyone with information that may help the investigation or find the murdered woman’s family, must urgently contact the Driekop Police Station’s
commander, Capt Samuel Segabutla, on 071 602 0460, or the crime stop number, 08600 10111, visit the nearest police station or use the My SAPS app. Police investigations continue.
