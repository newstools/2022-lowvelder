Louise Francis Stevenson (79), fondly referred to as the “Orchid Lady” in the Lowveld, found her love of orchids after her husband, Herman, gave her one to celebrate the news that they were expecting twins. This was more than 50 years ago. Stevenson was attacked on her farm at the end of January to such an extent that it landed her in hospital. Her daughter, Trish Stevenson, made the decision to bring her mother home where she passed away on March 20, in her home, surrounded by her beloved dogs and plants, and with the comfort of holding wool and knitting needles one last time. Right up to the end, even from her hospital bed, Louise gave orders for a new section of a shade house that had to be cleared for new plants that she was going to order. Louise had been in the Lowveld since 1963 when her parents moved here from Pretoria. The Lowveld is also where she met her husband who would inevitably bring orchids into her life.

During her life, she managed 13 trips to Thailand to find new stock for herself and her clients, in that order. Somehow, she found time to run a needlework shop (Stitch-Craft) manage her orchids, put three kids through school, come home and cook one of her fantastic dinners, and end the evening with one of her needlework projects. Following the death of Herman in 2006, Louise realised that time on the farm was more important than eight hours in a shop. Although she forever missed her clients with their life stories, she was very happy to be with her orchids. Another element of change after his passing were the dogs. They were never allowed on the bed, but with his space now empty, it took three dogs to fill. She and Trish often laughingly remarked how he would react to this change in the household.

She loved knitting tiny teddies and beanies for premature babies and Louise carried on her legacy, knitting more than a thousand teddies for Childline and GRIP. Her children and grandchildren were each a light in her life in their own special way.  There is Michael, her eldest son, and then the twins Robert and Trish. Robert and his wife, Urna, also gave her two loving, caring grandchildren, Nicola and Grant, who gave her endless pleasure. Trish inherited her mother’s feistiness which ensured many a stand-off, but she always had an interesting story when coming home having smuggled a few plants for Louise. “You worried about me when I disappeared up into Africa for months or weeks at a time and could not wait for my weekly phone calls from tickie boxes from all over south and east Africa. The calls always ended with, ‘Keep your eyes open for any orchids, hey?’”  Trish moved in with her mother after her father’s passing and never left, staying in her own house on the farm. In their tribute to this remarkable woman, her family ended off with these words: “Louise never gave up; life gave up on her, and that is something for us as family and friends that will take time to sink in. “Go well Louise, mom, mommy, nanna. We will miss you!”             Do you have more information about the story? Please send us an email to editorial@lowvelder.co.za.
