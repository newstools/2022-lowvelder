Premier Stan Mathabatha spearheaded the signing of a memorandum of cooperation on the rehabilitation of roads in various municipalities in Limpopo last Thursday. The decision to rehabilitate the roads emanates from the cross-governmental partnership between Roads Agency Limpopo (RAL), the Limpopo Department of Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure and various municipalities. This initiative has seen RAL invited to assist with road construction skills as part of encouraging synergy between government departments and local municipalities.
Addressing the premier’s intergovernmental forum held recently, Mathabatha emphasised the matter of collaboration in provision of service as paramount in advancing economic development and recovery. “We are one government; therefore we should use available resources and skills to develop our province in a collaborative manner. This fundamental intervention and partnership that is going to be signed is one great step towards improving the condition of roads within our towns, as well as assisting in economic recovery,” said Mathabatha. RAL chairperson, Matome Ralepibi, said, “The goal is to target the construction and rehabilitation of roads that are catalytic to the economic development of Limpopo. As the board of RAL, we also adopted the strategic partnership approach to join hands with the private sector and municipalities. We believe together we can win the battle to reduce the road infrastructure backlog in the province”.
The signing ceremony was attended by the MEC of the Limpopo Department of Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure, Dr Namane Dickson Masemola, the chairperson of RAL, the board of directors, executive mayors and mayors from various municipalities in Limpopo.
