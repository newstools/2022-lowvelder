They were the world’s first company to successfully apply spray-on polyurethane to bakkie load beds in South Africa in 1983. The company has always striven to design, develop and sell top-quality equipment and protective coatings.  Rhino Linings not only endeavours to offer leading equipment and coatings products, but also strive for excellence in customer service and satisfaction. This is apparent in the company’s ISO quality certification.  Their products are spray-applied and set within seconds, which allows the vehicle to return to service the same day. The coatings’ contours fit any vehicle, giving an air- and watertight bond to the substrate, effectively protecting it against rust, impact and abrasive damage.  They have become internationally renowned for their superior protection offered to delivery vehicles and are the only approved supplier to most of the major OEM manufacturers in South Africa.  Their products not only effectively adhere to steel, but bonds to cement, wood, fibreglass and many other surfaces. Many clients have realised that the protection offered by their products can therefore be extended to other assets. Over the years, the applications have grown into several other product divisions besides vehicle protection, and include industrial, mining, flooring and waterproofing applications.  With such a wide range of application possibilities and almost 40 years of history, it is easy to see why Rhino Linings is an excellent choice if you are looking for a business opportunity. “Whether you want to start your own business or grow your existing one, Rhino Linings makes great sense. Our processes, training and technical backup has led to people from all walks of life having been able to successfully realise their dreams of becoming in charge of their own destiny,” said Phil de Wet, the managing director of Rhino Linings.
