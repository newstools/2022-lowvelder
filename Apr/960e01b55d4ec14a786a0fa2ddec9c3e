Themba Sibiya, spokesperson for TCLM, slammed those involved in such activities, labelling the act as nothing but pure criminality. He issued this warning on behalf of TCLM on Tuesday April 26. TCLM has also placed a legal notice in Steelburger/ Lydenburg News, but the fraud is still continuing. Sibiya said it is evident that these perpetrators enjoy a monopoly market in which they attract potential buyers. “These swindlers approach unsuspecting and desperate members of the public and demand money upfront as a guarantee to secure residential sites for them from the municipality. TCLM has not given anyone the authority to sell residential sites on its behalf and therefore distances itself from such fraudulent activities. Residential sites, if available, can be purchased directly from the municipality,” said Sibiya. The following regulations are in place for the buying and selling of municipal land: 1. The municipality will advertise residential sites for sale in the local media and through the notice boards at all municipal offices in line with Section 79(18) of the Local Government Ordinance, 1939 (Ordinance 17 of 1939), as amended and read together with Section 21 of the Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 as amended and Section 14(2) of the Municipal Finance Management Act 56 of 2003 regarding the disposal of municipal-owned erven. 2. The list containing the description of the residential sites for sale together with the price list will be made available at municipal offices for public access. 3. Application forms will be issued to those interested to apply. 4. An official correspondence will be issued informing the applicant of the outcome of their application and giving further instructions to be followed. The public is urged to report those involved in these criminal activities to the police to bring those responsible to book
