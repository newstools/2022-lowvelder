The hunt was on at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre on Saturday morning as youngsters ran wild in search of Easter eggs.  This is the second year the centre has hosted this event, and judging by the turnout, there will surely be a third year. At registration, participants received a map of the centre showing 34 of the stores marked as “treasure” spots.  Off they went, exchanging little stickers for Easter eggs at the various spots.

The idea was to give the various stores exposure.  And while the kids were off searching for their sweet treasures, adults could enjoy the shops, restaurants and an art fair. Raffle tickets were also sold for a draw taking place at the end of the hunt. These funds went to Rotary Interact. Do you have more information about the story?
