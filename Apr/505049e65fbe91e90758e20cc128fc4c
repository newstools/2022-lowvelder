Sensei Noeleen Snyman has introduced karate to the communities of Steelpoort and Burgersfort in a bid to instil discipline among the youth. The name of the club is Katana Shotokan Karate Club and its members have already shown a day-by-day improvement since the beginning. They recently competed in Mbombela and brought home 27 medals during the Shotokan Karate Championship. “We teach the children the five disciplines of karate: character, effort, sincerity, self-control and etiquette. We also
teach them to defend themselves,” Snyman said.
“We all know that these days young people get into drugs and alcohol abuse and the life of crime, because they do not have anything to do. This is my way of giving them another alternative.” Snyman said she gets a lot of support from the community and that she has about 20 students in the club. Anyone who wants to join them, can visit the club at Burgersfort NGS offices or in Steelpoort at the Winterveld Recreational Club. They can also contact Snyman on 084 307 7847.
