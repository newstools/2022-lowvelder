With the delays in appointing a new contractor, it seems as if motorists will just have to bear with these conditions for a little longer. The spokesperson for the project manager, Independent Development Trust (IDT), Phasha Mokgolane, confirmed that they had not yet appointed a new contractor, but that they are still in the process. ALSO READ: More than five cops attacked in one week Two ditches were left open when Thenjwa Enginering Projects (TEP) was appointed by IDT to build a secondary access road to the Mpumalanga High Court in 2019, and some water pipes and cables near the Koraalboom traffic circle had to be dug up. TEP was instructed to stop working on the project because of a misunderstanding between the company and the engineer of the project manager. Since then, these ditches have been left open, inconveniencing motorists in that area for about two years now. Mokgolane promised that they would appoint a new contractor before the end of March.

In terms of time frames to finish the work, once a subcontractor is on-site, it will take between three to four weeks to complete,” said Mokgolane. Do you have more information about the story?
