Not even storms could keep the audience away from Martin Bester’s live performance at Yoons@Barnyard on Friday night, March 25. Although the show was set to start at 18:00, a massive storm hit the town just after 16:00, and continued throughout the evening, severely delaying the arrival of all the audience members, Bester and his bandmates.  A large percentage of the ticket sales went to Huis Betlehem, a charity organisation that provides a place of safety for children who had to be removed from their families. The Huis Betlehem team also brought along several children from the home to enjoy the show. Gradually, fans of the Radio Jacaranda DJ and musician arrived at the venue, enjoying drinks from the Barnyard’s bar and food made on-site by Yoons.

Performing several powerfully delivered covers of popular Afrikaans and English songs as well as originals, Bester elicited lots of cheers and applause, a sure sign that the audience members had a spectacular evening despite the earlier downpour.
