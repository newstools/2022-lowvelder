Cyclists, runners, family and friends pelted through the small town in a rainbow of colours. Although the morning was windy and rainy, no one held back at the event. The cyclists had the option to ride a 25- or 42-kilometre route, which allowed them to experience the beauty of the Kruger border. The runners could decide between running or walking down the 10-kilometre or short five-kilometre route specifically designed to experience nature.

It was a blessing, and we are grateful the runners and cyclists could find their way back after all the road signs had been blown away by the weather,” said the organiser, Losaan Meiring.
