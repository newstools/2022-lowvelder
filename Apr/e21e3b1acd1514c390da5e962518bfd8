Grace Family Fellowship Church is presenting Easter as a journey through various “stations” this year. As is explained when one enters the exhibition, each one of the stations or experiential stops symbolically revisits an event surrounding Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection.  Each station gives the opportunity, by using the guidelines provided, to stop at the applicable Scripture and examine the possible point of view of various characters (Peter, Mary mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, a soldier) or experience a personal application.

Each station can be further experienced through visual elements and suggested actions.  At some one can light candles. At another one can drive a nail into the cross, to symbolise something you would like to leave behind.There is also communion available at one station.

They are welcome to partake in those they feel led to. ALSO READ: New hiking club in Kgautšwana The exhibition is located within the church at 1 Loco Street Vintonia (you enter next to U Joint).
