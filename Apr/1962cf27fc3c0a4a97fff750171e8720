Two suspects, one armed with a nine-millimetre and one with an AK-47, robbed a house in Stein Street, Barberton. Sakkie Dedman, the manager of Hi-Tech Barberton, said a Ford Ranger double cab had been taken. The bakkie owner had been busy with a braai and had gone into the house to get refreshments when two armed men appeared out of nowhere. The suspects instructed everyone present to lock the dogs away and to give them a white powder that would make them fall asleep.

The vehicle was recovered in Ext 18 by a tracker company at approximately 22:00. The CPF joined them on the scene,” said Dedman. He also said people are relaxed and go about their normal business and criminals see this behaviour as a major advantage to do what they do best. “Let’s stand together and be vigilant as this is becoming a huge concern, a few vehicles were taken last night alone. Make sure your doors are locked. Don’t think because you are in front of your property that these criminals won’t enter your premises. Let’s be safe and make Barberton a safer place for all,” said Dedman.
