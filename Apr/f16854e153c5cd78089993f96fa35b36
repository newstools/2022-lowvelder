By April 18, which marked the end of the Easter holidays, about 20 people have lost their lives on the province’s roads. According to Moeti Mmusi, the spokesperson for the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison (DCSSL), irresponsible driving appeared to have been the primary source for these fatal crashes. As traffic volumes were expected to increase on Monday, law enforcement officials were deployed to various roads, especially where large number of accidents are registered.  “There has been a huge increase in law enforcement visibility, which we believe has assisted the traffic control police in clamping down on reckless driving while other motorists have complied with the rules of our road. Our numbers indicate so far that we currently have had 20 fatalities from April 14 to 18. We can expect them to increase when motorists drive back home,” he said.
