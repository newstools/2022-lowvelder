Anglers from far and wide arrived at the dam close to 04:30 with their boats full of fishing equipment. The bit of cooler weather towards the change of the season the weatherman had hinted to and the possibility of some big catches, lured many boats into the water; 24 boats large and small and 54 anglers entered the friendly competition.

The runner-up team were Supa Fly, Charles Kerridge and Divan Schoeman, with a bag weight of 4.09 kilograms, and in third place was team Bucket Mouth, Joniel Marks and Matthew Douglas, with their bag weight of 3.53 kilograms. Schoeman caught the biggest fish of the day among the seniors, one of 2.53 kilograms, and CJ Bezuidenhout the biggest fish among the junior competitors, 0.72 kilograms. Most teams did well as they got their limit of five fish per boat, however, the big fish proved to be more elusive throughout the day. It was a bumper-to-bumper turnout fuelled by excitement by the chances to win some prizes. Local businesses, tackle shops and many other sponsors supported this competition.
