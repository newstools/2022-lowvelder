This gives parents the opportunity to see what their children have learned and the models, in turn, the opportunity to demonstrate their skill on stage. “We are the only modelling organisation that hosts non-competitive, top-quality events for our students to develop their skill and to build confidence to perform in front of an audience.” Master Models focuses on model training and Paterson said they have incredible local and international success stories. “The stronghold of the organisation is the recognition of achievements in all aspects of life, including academics, sport, culture and community achievements.” ALSO READ: Plaston now three months without electricity A special mention was also given to a group of models booked to attend the International Talent Showcase in America in July this year.
