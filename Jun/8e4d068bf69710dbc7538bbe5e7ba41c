MBOMBELA – This is the view of Sipho Sibeko, general manager of the Department of Energy at the municipality. These calculations form part of a technical report which was drawn up by Sibeko for the municipal council after a flood of complaints about constant power outages from residents in wards 15, 16 and 17, was discussed during a meeting with the city’s top management in late April. During the meeting, residents aired their frustrations with the numerous and untimely outages, mainly due to Delta Substation’s switchgear failing when the system is overloaded.
Sibeko said in his report that the council currently only has R55m available in its budget.

According to his report Delta’s constant outages are due to ageing infrastructure and poor maintenance. “The equipment is obsolete and the procurement of spares is difficult since production of some of these has been discontinued. “The residential and commercial growth and business developments are putting more demand and overloading the infrastructure,” he said.
The report also indicates the 33kV lines in the electricity network have high transmission losses and have also aged. “The current network will struggle to accommodate further development. Funding has been made available to upgrade the existing infrastructure at Delta to extend its lifespan. “The 33Kv transmission lines need refurbishment and upgraded to 132kV to reduce transmission losses and to accommodate future development and growth,” Sibeko said. • Delta Substation: R68m with only R33m available.
• The new 132kV line from West Acres to Steiltes to Valencia: R24m with only R12m available.
• The new132kV line from Valencia to Delta: R16m with no funds in the budget.
