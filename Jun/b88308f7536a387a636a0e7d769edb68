EDG Steelpoort has vowed to save lives and to reduce accidents at local schools. The management of EDG decided to donate scholar patrol equipment to Kgoboko Primary School at Ga Phasha on March 26. The equipment includes stop signs, reflective vests, hats, white traffic gloves and flags, as well as whistles.
Almost 80% of the school learners cross the public road near the school every day. Merriam Nkuna of EDG said the donation came after they realised the road close to the school is always busy and the company hopes the donation will help make drivers around the school aware that pedestrians and learners are present. “With lots of excitement at school every day, the learners are not always concerned with traffic on the busy roads surrounding their school,” said Nkuna. She said motorists will also be notified that they are approaching a school area with the help of signs. “Many drivers don’t respect pedestrians, especially at crossing zones. They only take notice of traffic officers, but we believe with this donation they will now obey the rules of the road as the learners will be acting as traffic officers for others to cross the roads safely.” Educator at the school Lulleth Bantswile Boshego was grateful for the donations. “Our learners struggled to get to school on time but now that we have received these donations they will be on time and will be safe. The younger kids struggled to cross the roads on busy days. We appreciate EDG’s dedication and we believe the donation will make a huge difference.”
