He said he has also experienced congestion and difficulty driving on the Ga-Malekane bridge and knows what it feels like during peak hours. “It’s in a dire state and needs attention. The construction of the new bridge will ease traffic flow and benefit the socio-economic status. I have my pickaxe, shovel, boots and overalls, and I am ready to go on-site,” Masemola said. According to the MEC, the delays are being attended to, and the department remains committed to completing the construction. He said the Road Agency Limpopo’s engineering team has also been communicating about the technicalities and processes involved, which he is monitoring closely.
