BURGERSFORT – Opposition parties in Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality (FTLM) are concerned about the state of the Ga-Motodi Sports Complex. The stadium’s construction started in 2019 by Kipp Consulting in partnership with Sihle Civil Mwelase Thobs JV Contractors. Both the EFF and the DA in FTLM have written to the municipal manager, Walter Phala, to request that the Ga-Motodi Sports complex be completed according to the project specifications.
The two parties said they had conducted an oversight to the sport stadium, where they found many defects and shoddy workmanship. “There is no stormwater drainage or water reticulation system as per the scope of the project. The are no parking facilities. There are no changing rooms and also the pavilion has no roof,” said the DA’s Tumelo Molapo.
“The stadium is not even five years old, and already the palisades surrounding the stadium are run down due to rain damage and animals roaming on the pitch,” added the EFF’s Tseke Malepe. “It is beyond comprehension that this project, funded by a municipal infrastructure grant with a budget of R13 203 249, is reflected in the municipality’s 2020/21 annual report as ‘completed’.
“This sports complex was meant to provide access to recreational activities for the people of Ga-Motodi and surrounding villages, but instead it is one of the many incomplete and neglected sport complexes around the province; a legacy of the impassive ANC government,” said Molapo. The parties said they fear the stadium will be another white elephant in the FTLM. Steelburger/Lydenburg News forwarded queries to the FTLM’s communications team. By the time of going to press, no response had been received from the municipality.
