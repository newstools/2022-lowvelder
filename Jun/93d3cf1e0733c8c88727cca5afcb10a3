The SPCA held its pop-up mini market at the weekend, raising a small amount of funds for the dogs and cats in its care as a result.  The warm winter sun and clear blue skies made for welcome weather for both the organisers and visitors to the market, which started at 09:00 on Saturday June 18 and ended at about 12:00 at the White River SPCA kennels. ALSO READ: Lowvelders support motorbike accident victim Estelle de Villiers, the chairperson of the SPCA, said that while the mini market only attracted a small number of guests, the SPCA was able to raise R1 300 in the process.  On sale at the market was a large selection of second-hand books and clothing. Delicious vetkoek and mince was also on sale as well as a variety of garden and house plants.  De Villiers thanked all those who came out to support the market and said although it was a quiet day, it was still a good one.
