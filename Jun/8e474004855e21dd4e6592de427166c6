It is that time of year again when the SPCA in White River invites its supporters to join in on its annual general meeting (AGM). The AGM will take place tonight, June 29, at Ingwenyama Lodge and will start at 18:30. “We would love to tell you about our society, staff and the great support from our community,” said the SPCA’s chairperson, Estelle de Villiers.

If an AGM is not quite your thing, another way to support this society, is to support the Car Boot Sale at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre on Saturday July 2 from 08:00 to 12:00.  If you would like to set up a stall yourself, it will cost you R100, but all other proceeds go to yourself.
