The Lowveld Knife Show held at i’langa Mall over the weekend saw an array of beautiful and expertly hand-forged knives on show, from the Lowveld to Limpopo and even Vereeniging. Held inside the mall near Cappuccinos, the show ran over June 18 and 19, coinciding with Father’s Day on Sunday. The organiser of the event and knifesmith Phillip Daniel said the idea for the show was to showcase all the local knifesmiths and the amazing talent in our area. “We had knifemakers from Limpopo and Vereeniging as well as from the local areas such as Barberton, White River, Secunda and Sabie come to showcase their hand-forged knives,” said Daniel. “The turnout was excellent and we made quite a few sales during the show. The exhibitors also seemed to really enjoy themselves,” he said.
The show also awarded some of the exhibitors for their knives. The Best of Show Award went to RE Blades from Hoedspruit, while the Best Hunting Knife on Show Award went to local knifesmith Jaco Knoetze of Knoetze Handmade Knives. Knoetze said at the show that he had only started making knives eight months ago. The Best Culinary Knife Award went to Lionhearted Bladeworks, while the Best Folder went to Iaan du Toit of Sabie.
The show also included a raffle to raise funds for K9 Search and Rescue teams, specifically Ground SAR South Africa, to help with K9 Search and Rescue operations. “All of the work is done by volunteers and is self-funded,” said Daniel.
The raffle prize was a hand-forged knife and was won by a young White River resident, Fynn Harmon.
