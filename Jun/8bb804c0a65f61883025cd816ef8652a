The SPCA said that they still need dog kennels, shade nets, canvas, blankets and food for dogs, chickens and pigs. “We will appreciate any donation to help the animals in these areas. Animals are sentient beings with physical and emotional needs and it is our duty to ensure that they live the best life possible,” said the SPCA.
