STEELPOORT – A local NPO has given back to needy schools this winter. Gatsheni Lifeway Hope Organisation recently visited four schools under the #KeepKidsAtSchoolsThisWinter campaign. “We donated schools shoes, sanitary towels and stationery to Kgahlanong and Mogale wa Bagale technical high
schools. We also assisted both Maelebe and Shopiane primary schools with the same parcels,” said Pr Themba Ndlovu, founder of the NPO. He said they also motivated and prayed with them. “The message to them was, ‘I’m smart, I’m unstoppable and I can do anything: girl power’.
“The idea behind this was that nothing should stop any child from attending school, and to bring hope to the communities.” Ndlovu thanked all the sponsors, which included members of the Grace Fellowship Church, Burgersfort SAPS, Samancor Eastern Chrome Mines and GHH Mining Machines for supporting his initiative
