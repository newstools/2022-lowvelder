Aside from the Warm Fest held in the Lowveld National Botanical Garden, the day also doubled up as a welcome back for the Lowveld’s Currie Cup heroes. “We Are the Champions” rang through the garden as the Airlink Pumas were loudly cheered onto the stage as captain Willie Engelbrecht held the trophy high above his head.  What followed was a series of cheers and song as both the team and the crowd fed off the champion atmosphere that has been pervading the air since Friday afternoon. ALSO READ: Get our game on: meet the Springbok squad Coach Jimmy Stonehouse and Engelbrecht thanked the crowd for their amazing support, without which their win would not have been possible.  Wave upon wave, the Pumas formed part of the day. One moment, Stonehouse was singing “Sweet Caroline”, the next, a player or two joined Hoërskool Nelspruit’s revue on stage, much to their own and the crowd’s delight.
