The police have a mandate to ensure they curb any criminal activity on the streets, including drugs, which are ruining young and old people’s lives,” he said.  Two suspects were arrested for possession of dagga with an estimated street value of R250 000 on the R40 between White River and Mbombela last week. In another incident, a 37-year-old man was nabbed in Kaapmuiden on June 10 for possession of dagga, which had an estimated street value of R150 000. Mohlala sent a strong warning to those who are dealing in and smuggling dagga, that it would not be tolerated. He warned them that even if they manage to sometimes evade the police, they will eventually be caught.  He also pleaded with members of the public to notify the police when they see people dealing in or transporting any form of drugs.
