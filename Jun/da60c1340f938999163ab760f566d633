Registration will remain open until July 29, for children who will go to school for the first time or move to a new school next year. “All our schools have been identified as designated areas for collection and submission of admission forms. Parents and legal guardians of qualifying learners are therefore encouraged to immediately collect registration forms from the school nearest to their home, where other siblings are attending or within a feeder zone. “Completed forms must be returned as soon as possible as admissions will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis, assuming that all other criteria in the admissions guidelines are met,” said MEC Polly Boshielo in a media statement. She urged parents to bring birth certificates or acceptable proof of a birth date, immunisation cards, transfer cards or last report cards. She added, “School management teams have been directed to ensure that the process of collection and return of forms is managed in line with the Department of Education’s standard operating procedures for the management of Covid-19 in schools. This means strict adherence to screening, sanitising and social distancing protocols throughout the process.” Any formal complaint from parents whose children have not been admitted can be lodged through the nearest circuit offices. Boshielo said the department will monitor the learner admission process very closely to ensure that the rights of learners are always protected.
