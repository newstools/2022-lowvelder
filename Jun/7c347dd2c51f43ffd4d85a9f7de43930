The Picnic Sundays series hosted veteran South African band Prime Circle at the Lowveld Botanical Garden on Sunday June 5.  With picnic baskets and blankets in tow, Lowvelders gathered on the grass before the stage, ready to rock and sing along with the popular band. Opening for Prime Circle was Brian Wilkinson of local band DARE to Believe.  Prime Circle started their set at 15:00 and were cheered on enthusiastically after each and every set by an excited audience.
