BURGERSFORT – Trainee traffic officers in the Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality (FTLM) have confirmed
their contracts with the municipality are ending this month. Ten volunteers braved the cold winter days and the Covid-19 hard lockdown in 2020, directing traffic in the busy town CBD. They told Steelburger/Lydenburg News they are leaving their posts without proper recognition. “We were promised certificates of accreditation after completing the training, but now we are told we won’t be getting them. We are leaving with nothing after we devoted our time, risking our lives on a daily basis.
“All we need is a paper or document confirming that we volunteered as traffic officers. This can help us in our future job searches,” said the officers.
“Those who occupied these posts before us, were honoured with certificates, but why not us?” They said they have been enrolled in this programme since 2019. They learnt about traffic law enforcement and road safety and related fields. These included field-related training in which they controlled traffic in town on a daily basis. “Our plea is that we want certificates bestowed on us to indicate that we completed the training. We reported the matter to our bosses at FTLM, but no one is willing to listen to our pleas.” Two weeks ago, Steelburger/Lydenburg News forwarded queries to the FTLM’s communications team, enquiring about these concerns raised by the officers. Although the municipality confirmed receiving the questions, it had yet to respond by the time of going to press.
