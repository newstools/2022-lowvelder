The day was commemorated under the theme Rediscover Play, Recover Through Play. In its invitation to the day Penreach said, “Playing is fundamental to children’s holistic development and has an important role in helping them deal with challenges, and make sense of what is happening around them”. Penreach communication officer Dumisile Masuku said there were about 30 early childhood development (ECD) centres in attendance on the day. Teachers and caretaker alike had their hands full with groups of kids being led from one activity to the next, but it was laughs and fun all around.
