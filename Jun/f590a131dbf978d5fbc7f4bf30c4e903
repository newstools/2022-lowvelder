International Day of Yoga is celebrated every year on June 21 across the world, after the United Nations designated it so in 2014 to promote yoga to the international community. The consulate general of India wishes to celebrate this special occasion in Mbombela by holding a yoga camp in the Lowveld National Botanical Garden on June 11. Be there at 09:00 for 09:30; the camp will run until 11:00. One of the organisers, Mahesh Srini, said last year’s yoga camp was such a great success and the participants enjoyed it thoroughly, albeit under a drizzle of rain.

As usual, we welcome first-time participants while inviting others who just want to have some fun or those interested in their mental and physical well-being. “We hope that some of the yoga teachers and yoga experts who are present shall share the benefits of yoga and provide words of wisdom to help you to incorporate it into your day-to-day lifestyle.” ALSO READ: No confirmation of national shutdown occurring in Mbombela Srini said yoga is for wellness for everyone and purely a science – the science of well-being, the science of integrating the body, mind, and soul, the science of actualising our full potential. A few complimentary tickets are available on a first come, first served basis. Everyone is, however, welcome to attend. You will only have to pay the entrance fee to the botanical garden. Signage will be posted to direct you to the venue. Free refreshments, sponsored by Crossing SPAR, will be provided to participants.
