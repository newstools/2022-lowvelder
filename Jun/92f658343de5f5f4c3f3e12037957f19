A brave Hi-Tech reaction officer went above and beyond the call of duty over the weekend when he managed to stop and extinguish a gas fire from spreading in a local home.  The officer, Thembelani Msimango, received a call on Saturday June 18 just after 15:00, alerting him to a house fire in Porcupine Street near Laerskool Bergland.

It is believed the fire had started from a gas bottle in the house.  He said when Msimango arrived at the house, the neighbours had a fire extinguisher and hosepipe ready. “It took him about 20 minutes to put the fire out,” said Mac Pherson.  The homeowners could not be reached by the time of going to press.  Mac Pherson has urged the public to take care with heaters this winter, be they gas or electrical.  “Always have a fire extinguisher ready in your home,” he said.
