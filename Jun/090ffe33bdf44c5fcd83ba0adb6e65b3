Volunteers, sponsors and those who felt the need for support and prayer in their lives, attended the evening. It was hosted by Step, Jethro House, Hi-Q Lydenburg, Supa Quick, Hoërskool Lydenburg and the Living Word Church. All the guests received a warm cup of soup and some went home with new blankets. Learners of Hoërskool Lydenburg had donated 500 blankets to Step the previous week and these were handed out. This praise and worship evening was aimed to pray and reach out in the warm embrace of fellowship.
“New friendships were made and we could see God has something bigger in mind. We needed the people to step out of their comfort zone and explore the richness of God’s diverse world,” said the Step director, Hester van Zilj.
