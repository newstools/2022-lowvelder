His songs are bound to still be on loop in locals’ heads after ending Picnic Sundays with a bang.  Jeremy Loops and his band were the last act to grace the Lowveld National Botanical Garden as part of this series, and there could not have been a better choice for it. Prior to their performance, local talents Coenie Naudé and Brian Wilkinson entertained the crowd as they lounged around on their picnic blankets sipping away at their drinks and enjoying some snacks.  As was the case with Spoegwolf’s turn in the garden, Loops had people scrambling to the front and jumping up and down to his mesmerising beats.
