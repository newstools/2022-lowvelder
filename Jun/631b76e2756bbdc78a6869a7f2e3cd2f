The budget was presented during a special council sitting on Tuesday May 31. According to Cllr Marius Opperman of Thaba Chweu Local Municipality’s (TCLM) Ward 14, the municipality is currently operating at a deficit and does not have any revenue collecting strategy. “This budget is unfunded. If necessary, the DA will also press criminal charges, as adoption of an unfunded budget is illegal in terms of section 18 of the Municipal Finance Managing Act,” said Opperman. Steelburger/Lydenburg News published the budget and integrated development plan (IDP) on Thursday May 9.
After a vote by the majority party, the budget was approved.
According to Themba Sibiya, media and marketing manager of TCLM, the projected budget revenue is R828.8m for the current financial year. Out of this projection, 63% will be generated and collected by the municipality and 37% will be collected from grants. The budget reflects a deficit of R185m.
