The Terra del Capo Pinot Grigio, a white wine made from red grapes, he described as a light and easy breakfast wine. Long live Capetonian habits! This wine was voted best value for money at R77 per bottle. The Cape of Good Hope Altima Sauvignon Blanc was next on the list and was selected as wine of the evening. Van Buuren, in charge of the white and rosé varieties, might have swayed the vote with his excellent presentation and likeable character. This was followed by the award-winning Jean Roi Rosé 2021, made in the Provençal style. The main course that everybody swooned over was fillet steak done to perfection with a red wine and berry sauce, carrot purée, fondant potatoes, braised baby onions and Brussels sprouts. This was accompanied by the Terra del Capo Sangiovese – a good accompaniment for red meats, pasta and tomato dishes, followed by an out-of-the-ordinary Cape of Good Hope Syrah 2017. For dessert, André du Preez showed off with a mille-feuille with Belgian chocolate mousse. The next wine tasting will feature Café Crust’s new wine list and menu on Thursday June 24 18:30.
