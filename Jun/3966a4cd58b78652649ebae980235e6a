Former SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo was appointed the head coach of Sekhukhune United last Wednesday. The Zimbabwean was added to Babina Noko’s technical team after the release of co-coach Owen Da Gama recently. Da Gama was co-coaching along with MacDonald Makhubedu. In a statement, the club said, “Sekhukhune United FC is delighted to announce the appointment of Tembo to the technical team of Babina Noko. “Tembo is our head coach for the coming season. He will be assistant by Makhubedu and Thabo Senong.”
Tembo said, “It’s my desire that Sekhukhune United must be up there fighting for silverware to make their supporters happy. I’m looking forward to have a long-lasting working relationship with the management, players and members of the technical team. I cannot wait to start preparations for the next season.” The club’s chairperson, Simon Malatji, said, “I’d like to take this opportunity to welcome Tembo to the Babina Noko family. We’re very much excited to have Tembo on our team, and we believe he will assist us to achieve the goals Sekhukhune United FC has set itself.”
