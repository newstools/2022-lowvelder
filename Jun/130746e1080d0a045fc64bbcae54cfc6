Molori Moses Sihlangu (known as Moses) passed away on Tuesday May 10,
surrounded by his family, a few days after
his 103rd birthday. Sihlangu was born on April 29, 1919.
He was born in Mashishing, went to
school there and worked at McGee Garage for most of his life, until retirement in 1972.  He ventured into different businesses after that, including the taxi industry. He was the co-founder of the Uniting
Reformed Church of Southern Africa in
Mashishing with Rev Greyling in 1960.
He served as an elder in the church for
42 years and worked with all the reverends during his years as a church leader. He was recognised by the Social
Development Programme of Mpumalanga for his long life and received a certificate when he turned a 102 last year. Sihlangu lived by the Bible verse Psalm
118:22: “The stone which the builders
refused has become the headstone of the
corner”. “My father believed the Lord chose the
people to honour His name as headstones and anchors in the community. He did so much for the church and the community and was a proud man. We will honour his name and our family will continue his legacy in faith,” said his son, Timonthy Sihlangu. He was blessed with three sons, one
daughter and 38 grandchildren and great-grandchildren during his life. The Sihlangu and Dube families would
like to express their gratitude to principal
Sibusiso Madonsela and his staff from
Marambane Primary School, Lydenburg
Taxi Association members, pastors of
Mashishing, friends, neighbours, the larger Mashishing community, Rev Themba Nene who came all the way from Piet Retief for the service, Dr Hajee for his continued care, and the Uniting Reformed Church of Southern Africa congregation and members.
