With an increase in vehicle break-ins around Mbombela, Hi-Tech’s Callum mac Pherson has urged the public to avoid leaving their valuables in their cars at all costs. Mac Pherson said Hi-Tech Security has been inundated with calls these past few weeks regarding valuables such as wallets, laptops and phones being stolen from people’s cars. “It is happening around Mbombela wherever there are vehicles gathered together, such as at schools, shopping centres – even houses that are having a party or a braai and have several cars parked outside the gate,” said Mac Pherson. He said there have been a few cases reported in White River as well.

Please do not leave anything in your car that can be stolen,” he said.
