MECKLENBURG – The Grade 8 pupils of Mphachue Secondary School in Mogodi Village wanted to learn more about the history of Bapedi. This after they came across an extract in their social science text books, that highlighted the life of King Sekhukhune I, his assassination and the culture of Bapedi. The inquisitive learners urged their teachers to arrange a trip for them to the Tšate Heritage Site. The educational expedition took place last Thursday. “The pupils also wanted to learn and see the practical side of how the Bapedi had lived during those years. Some of our pupils said that they had never seen the statue of King Sekhukhune,” said a teacher, Bethuel Mahlakwane. He said the trip was an eye-opener to the learners. “They are now cultural-oriented and know much about their tradition.” At the Tšate Heritage Site, the pupils were educated by Seraki Ntwampe a former lecturer at Dr CN Phatudi TVET College and Nkahloleng Chihlo, a cultural poet. The Tšate Heritage Site is situated in Ntswaneng Village, and was proclaimed a provincial heritage site in 2007. It portrays the natural and cultural history of the Sekhukhune region, the rise and fall of the Pedi Empire, living culture and the fascinating natural and geological environment in the surrounds of the site.
