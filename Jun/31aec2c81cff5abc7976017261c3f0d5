The Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism (KLCBT) said it will implement extra security measures on the Numbi Road during the upcoming long weekend of June 16, while finalising a permanent solution. KLBCT’s chief operating officer, Linda Grimbeek, said it has hired a private security company to assist the police in patrolling the road leading to the Kruger National Park.

We are busy obtaining funds to pay the security company so it can start patrolling the road full-time. We decided we should have people on the ground to protect the tourists,” she said. The name of the security company will not be divulged in order to protect it from attacks.
“Police and traffic officers will also be deployed to patrol the area. We assure our tourists that if they use the Numbi Road they will be protected going in and out,” she concluded.
