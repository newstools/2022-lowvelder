Lowvelders had to get all their ducks in a row on Saturday June 4 in a bid to raise funds for a local professional model, Monica Viljoen.  The Diva Bathtub Duck Race, according to Monica’s mother, Niki Viljoen, was planned to launch 1 000 yellow rubber ducks into the river at Friend’s Cafe to race to the Volle Evangelie Kerk.

The ducks were thrown into the Gladdespruit and drifted down past Montana Garden Pavilion to the finish line at the church. Tickets were sold between 11:00 and 12:30 at Friends Café on the race day, and the owners of the first three ducks to cross the line received a cash prize.  The first prize of R5 000 went to Jenna Botha. Second place went to Simone Odendaal, who received a cash prize of R3 000, and third place went to Pieter Engelbrecht, who won R2 000.

The prizes included a one-night stay at Pumba Wild Farm (won by Bennie Voster) and one weekend away in Hazyview (won by Ben de Winnar and Natasha Smit). All the funds raised at the race will go towards ensuring Monica gets to attend the International Modeling and Talent Association in New York next month.
