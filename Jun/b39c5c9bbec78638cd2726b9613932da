The dedication and eagerness to participate at higher levels in ringball are increasing in Tubatse. Three
players of the Vikings Ringball Club are over the moon. The trio were recently selected to represent the Ehlanzeni district in ringball. They will compete at the Ringball South Africa Super 9 Competition from July 3 to 9 in Pretoria. The hard-working players are Annika van Vreden, Meané Richter and Winé van Vreden. They are scheduled to participate in the under 15 competition. “We are looking to grow interest in the sport and add to our numbers,” said Louis van der Mescht of the Vikings Club. He congratulated the three ladies. “We are proud of their achievements as a club, and we believe they will raise our flag higher. We are optimistic that in the coming years we will have more players from our shores representing us in the games.”
