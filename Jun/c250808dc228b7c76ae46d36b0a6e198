The Kellysville, Marikana and Skhila communities competed in a Youth Day soccer and netball tournament on Thursday June 16 at the Kellysville Sportsgrounds. The organisers of the event were Beryl Steele, Glynice Lodewyk and Ansie Gibley.
The team leaders were Mishan Flank (Kellysville United), Shane Flank Tshepiso (Silver Flames Lydenburg) and Penelope Mphakane (Skyballers Kellysville).
They would like to thank the community for coming out to support the teams, and DJ T. Mazibuko for providing the music.
