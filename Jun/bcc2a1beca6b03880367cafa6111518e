Now that the rain has abated and the soil is dry, work on Koraalboom Avenue continues unabated.  The ditches are filled up and the area is being cleared. The spokesperson for the Independent Development Trust (IDT), Phasha Mokgolane, said the contractor will finish work soon and the final phase is at hand. “The contractor is currently working according to plan to finish with the work. We cannot give the exact date when are they going to finish, but it will be before month-end. For now, we plead with communities to bear with us while we work on-site; we know that we have been there for some time now,” he said.

He also gave his assurances that “a dodgy job” will not be tolerated. The repairs will be assessed by an engineer to ensure the road’s lifespan will be long.
