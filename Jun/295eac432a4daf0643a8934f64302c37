The R533, the road between between Graskop and Bushbuckridge (Kowyn Pass), is closed until later this afternoon, June 13. The road closure was announced by the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM) via a Facebook post this morning. It is due to blasting activities that took place over the weekend. ALSO READ: One dead in car accident near Numbi Park TCLM said in the post that the contractor is currently on-site clearing loose rocks from the blasting that might cause damage to vehicles. Meanwhile, motorists travelling from Graskop to Bushbuckridge and vice versa are urged to use alternative routes.
