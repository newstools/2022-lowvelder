Call them barking mad, or mad about dogs, Lowvelder pet owners braved the cold morning air early on Saturday to take part in the Nelspruit SPCA Fun Run.   Held at the Eagles View Play Park, the fun run was organised by Monique Bornman, a councillor with the FF Plus in the Ehlanzeni District Municipality. “I’ve noticed that the Nelspruit SPCA is struggling, and since the Barberton branch has closed down, I thought it was best to help the local branch by organising this event for them,” said Bornman.  Scores of animal lovers gathered at the park at 07:00 on June 4, some with their pets, all in support of the SPCA. It is estimated there were at least 200 people.  Bornman said they managed to collect R8 000 in monetary donations and over 350kg of pet food, as well as several dog houses and blankets. The fun run had lots of support from the community and local businesses, and Bornman said they plan to hold another one soon. She said she hoped to make the event an annual fundraiser for the SPCA.
