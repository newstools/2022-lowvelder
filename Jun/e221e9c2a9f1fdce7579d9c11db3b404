Calcutta police arrested a 26-year-old man for being in possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition on Thursday June 23. A statement by a provincial police spokesperson, Brig Selvy Mohlala, said Calcutta police had attended to a complaint in Marite near Hazyview on Thursday evening after being informed that two trucks had allegedly been hijacked and reportedly used to blockade the R40 where people were protesting. “Upon arrival at the scene the police members started diverting motorists to use alternative routes,” said Mohlala.

He was then arrested and charged accordingly. The firearm will undergo ballistic testing to determine whether it had been used or not in the commission of other crimes.
