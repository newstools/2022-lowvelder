The Driving Licence Testing Centre (DLTC) in Mpumalanga is urging motorists to collect their driver’s licences from the offices where they applied.
Moeti Mmusi, the spokesperson for the Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, which is responsible for the DLTCs in the province, said there is a large number of cards that have not yet been collected at the centres.

The national office has dealt with the backlog and sped up the process to print the cards of those motorists whose licences expired during the lockdown,” he said.
He said there may be those who did not receive any SMSs to notify them that their cards are available.
“Their cards may already be at the centre, but they did not receive any notification. Our aim is to make sure that motorists receive their driver’s licences so that we can update the backlog,” Mmusi explained.

“Our DLTC is open to assist those who still need to renew their driver’s licences and our officials will assist them. The grace period expired a long time ago, which means motorists who are found with expired licences will be fined,” he concluded.  Do you have more information about the story?
