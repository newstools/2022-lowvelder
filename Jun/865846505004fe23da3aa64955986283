The ongoing war on rhino poaching is a topic that concerns every nature lover. In a new book that hit the shelves this month, Rhino War, retired Maj Gen Johan Jooste shed the light on his involvement with this battle to author Tony Park. Innibos will launch the book on Saturday July 2 at the Nagkantoor Kuierkroeg in Kaapsehoop. The event starts at 14:30 for 15:00 and costs R50. Park and Jooste will be in conversation about the battles and victories and take readers behind the scenes of this seemingly never-ending war. Park is the author of 20 novels and is often hailed as the successor of Wilbur Smith in the genre of adventure and action against the backdrop of Africa. Aside from the novels, he has also written several non-fiction books and biographies. In 2012, Jooste was parachuted into the seemingly unwinnable war against rhino poaching in the Kruger National Park. With poaching spiralling out of control, Jooste was given the mandate to “go military”, to convert Kruger’s ranger corps into a paramilitary force capable of taking the fight to the poachers. Aged 60, white, and a veteran with 35 years’ military service, Jooste’s controversial appointment was immediately met with resentment and outright hostility by elements of SANParks, the police, and even the military with which he had served. With the media, government, conservationists, human rights activists and the people of South Africa looking over his shoulder, Jooste had to battle opponents within and without to carry out his strategy for turning the tide on rhino poaching. Told through his eyes and penned down by Park, these stories of the courage and grit of rangers who risked their lives to protect wildlife in the face of a wily and determined foe are an account of heroism, sacrifice and determination. Rhino War is published by PanMacMillan and costs R358. It will be for sale by Exclusive Books at the event. RSVP: Annemarie van der Walt, Innibos, on 083 289 3823.
