The Nelspruit SPCA was called out to an incident in Steiltes yesterday, June 28, where it said a vervet monkey had been shot by what is suspected to have been a pellet gun.  “He was shot in the chest and was clearly in severe pain,” the society said. “To prevent further suffering, we euthanised him on-site. “What was done to him was utterly cruel and without our intervention, he would have died an agonising death.” The SPCA said it is a criminal offence to cause injuries to an animal and then leave it to suffer like this. It said it did not have any information or evidence as to who was responsible for this act.
