STEELPOORT – On Monday June 6 about 300 members of the Ngwaabe Concerned Group and the Mampuru Community Forum staged a peaceful protest at Two Rivers Platinum Mine, demanding jobs.   “We demand Ngwaabe communities be granted at least 825 cadets and at least 700 general worker posts over a period of three months (by the end of September). “We also want all recruitment posts to be advertised in the Ngwaabe cluster,” the protesters said while handing over a memorandum of demands. According to the protesters, they also want learnerships to be granted to at least 200 Ngwaabe locals. “The Ngwaabe cluster demands to nominate observers to ensure transparency and fairness in the procurement process. The mine has to empower and capacitate Ngwaabe small, medium and micro enterprises,” said
the protesters.
“We would love to tell the mine owners, management and all investors of all local mines we are the children of this land, and they are taking away our God-given minerals.
“We are not children of a lesser god, and we want to benefit from what belongs to us,” said the convener, Edward Phasha. The protesters warned they would be staging protests at other local mines to have their demands heard. The memorandum of demand was signed and accepted by Two Rivers’ general manager, Ntokozo Ngema. The mine promised to respond within 14 days.
