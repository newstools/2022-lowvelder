The Mpumalanga Division of the High Court has today convicted ex-cop Mugiyo Ulrich Mabunda for the premeditated murder of his wife, Tebogo Mabunda. Mugiyo did not appear in court during the judgement. Judge Cassim Moosa proceeded with the matter nevertheless and convicted him in his absence. This was not the first time Mugiyo did not appear for court. On October 11, 2021, the matter was postponed to October 13 as the accused was said to be ill and unable to attend. After the judge’s verdict, Tebogo’s family and friends had mixed emotions; some shouted with joy and some were crying. Outside the court, as with previous court sessions, family, friends, the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union, Mpumalanga ANC Women’s League and Bella’s Athletics Club picketed in support of the victim.
