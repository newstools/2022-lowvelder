Addressing the widespread speculation with regards to a possible national shutdown planned for tomorrow, June 10, the CPF’s chairperson, John Meintjies, issued a statement on the matter. “After taking the time to speak to various role players in our city, I would like to take this opportunity to state that this is now only speculation, and that there is no confirmation of any planned action in Nelspruit.
