The Hospice White River Shoppe had its official opening at the end of May and is fully stocked with anything and everything. The shop is located at 12A Peter Graham Street next to Hi-Tech’s office. It is open on weekdays from 09:00 to 16:00 and on Saturdays from 09:00 to 13:00. While you are there, chat to one of the volunteers about possibly offering up some of your free time.
