Albeit a little smaller than previous years, this past weekend’s CANSA Relay for Life was certainly a memorable one.  Eagles View Play Park is now the relay’s new home as its owner, Jaco Potgieter, is personally invested in the cause – he lost his daughter to cancer. After various groups and individuals had settled themselves around the track, the opening ceremony took place at 17:00.  Organisers decided that people who suffer from or due to cancer need a place where they can just go and be silent, and remember those they have lost or what they themselves have lost.

There are already some names on the benches, and you may approach Potgieter to have one of you loved ones’ immortalised there.  Candles were lit, walks were walked, and loved ones were remembered with tears in the eye, accompanied by smiles, due to the legacies left behind by those lost.
