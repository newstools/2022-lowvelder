The new Toyota Hilux Dakar-spec racing bakkies were seen around town and on the N4 as they visited local schools.  Imagine the roar of a V6 and V8 engine echoing through the streets, racing bakkies reaching speeds of over 100km/h in only a few seconds, executing 360-degree donuts, casually and effortlessly drifting around the corners and finally coming to a standstill on the school’s sport field – every traffic officers’ worst nightmare. “The children were cheering and jumping up and down with excitement. It seems like we have quite a few petrolheads in and around Nkomazi. It is our privilege to give back to the community and to showcase our sport to the next generation,” Eben Basson said.

Navigator Werner Horn, an old learner of Laerskool Malelane, introduced the vehicles to the children and reminded them to work hard for what they want in life.
On June 11, all three the TeamHiluxRallyRaid bakkies were on display at the Lowveld Clay Target Club outside Malalane. Lucky winners, friends, family, business partners and other members of the public were invited to join the team at the official launch, some lucky enough to get a spin in these machines.
