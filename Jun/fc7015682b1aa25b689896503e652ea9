The city’s third Bleedathon will be hosted at Nelspruit Rugby Club on June 26. This is not just your average blood donation drive, as there will be a whole range of food stuffs available with some added live music. A Pantry Food Festa and street food will have you covered when it comes to sustenance on the day. If you are an aspiring singer, you can sing between two and seven songs on stage for only R70. Call 082 897 7080 to book your spot. And, as with the previous Bleedathon, there will also be a shavathon running on the day. You choose, shave it all off or maybe just add some colour to it.

BUCO is the current holder of the floating trophy for most blood donations. The aim is to get as many of your employees, customers, family members, or any person you can convince on the day to donate blood under your team name. Does your business have what it takes to beat them in this round? If you think your business can give those already registered a go, or you would like to have a stall on the day, contact Ista van Zyl at vanzylista@gmail.com before Friday June 24.
