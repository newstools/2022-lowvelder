The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) called on the public to use the available water in a wise and sparing manner as water levels in the listed dams and catchment areas continue to drop. The DWS’s weekly state of reservoirs report of June 13 shows that the average water levels in the listed dams in the province recorded a further decline from last week’s 95.4% to 95.3%. The water management areas also recorded declines, with the Olifants dropping from 84.4% to 84.3% and the Inkomati-Usuthu dropping from 99.3% to 99.1%. The only listed dam that recorded some improvement in the Lowveld and Ehlanzeni District is the Da Gama Dam, which recorded an increase from 99.8% to 100.3%. Most of the listed dams in the Lowveld remained unchanged, with Kwena Dam at 100.4%, Blyderivierspoort at 100.4%, Buffelskloof at 100.3%, Witklip at 100.3%, Primkop at 101.1%, and Ohrigstad at 52.7%.
